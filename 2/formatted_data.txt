quite indisputable The stranger 1
to them Nor when 1
this respect The place 1
a dream Even if 1
nevertheless artistic That young 1
a poet but surely 1
a poem That old 1
a philosopher but at 1
in others That scientific 1
he assumed He had 1
in biology but what 1
than himself Thus and 1
be regarded it had 1
of art A man 1
written comedy More especially 1
drifting cloud This again 1
monstrous fruit And this 1

the hero On many 1
to women The attitude 1

strange sunset It looked 1
the world All the 1
palpable plumage you could 1
the face Across the 1
pale green but towards 1
be seen The whole 1
violent secrecy The very 1
a secret It expressed 1
local patriotism The very 1
seemed small I say 1
oppressive sky There are 1
Saffron Park For a 1
a rival it was 1
suddenly ended The new 1
yellow hair But an 1
he looked He signalised 1
of poetry He said 1
of order nay he 1
of respectability So all 1
impossible sky In fact 1
respectable poet You say 1
of law I say 1
in terms I only 1
this garden The man 1
submissive solemnity The third 1
family oracle Gregory resumed 1
words anywhere An anarchist 1
an artist The man 1
to everything He sees 1
shapeless policemen An artist 1

disorder only If it 1
and tired I will 1
tell you It is 1
going right It is 1
will reach It is 1
but Victoria Oh their 1
wild rapture oh their 1
your poetry The rare 1

distant station Chaos is 1
to Bagdad But man 1
and lo it is 1
and prose let me 1
of pride Take your 1
of man give me 1
his victories Give me 1
you go inquired Gregory 1
against chaos You say 1
to Victoria I say 1
hairbreadth escape And when 1
unmeaning word It is 1
announcing conquest It is 1
indeed Victoria it is 1
of Adam Gregory wagged 1
got there You think 1
New Jerusalem We know 1
like Victoria Yes the 1
of heaven The poet 1
in revolt You might 1
sea sick Being sick 1
a revolt Both being 1
desperate occasions but I 1
are poetical Revolt in 1
is revolting It s 1
mere vomiting The girl 1
all poetry Yes the 1
all conventions For the 1
this lawn Syme looked 1
would do Gregory s 1
your pardon said Syme 1
my anarchism cried Gregory 1
dear fellow said Syme 1
strolled away With surprise 1
they say Do you 1
say now Syme smiled 1
Do you he asked 1
you mean asked the 1
and insincerity When you 1
mean it Now sometimes 1
does mean It may 1
tenth truth but then 1
meaning it She was 1
level brows her face 1
anarchist then she asked 1
that nonsense She drew 1
of thing Syme broke 1
Lord no he said 1
done anonymously And at 1
his safety Syme strolled 1
his opinions For he 1
humble one And it 1
too much the proud 1
too closely He defended 1
and exaggeration He grew 1
and propriety All the 1
round him Once he 1
the world He stared 1
few minutes and then 1
his feet To his 1
garden empty Everyone had 1
hurried apology He left 1
afterwards explain In the 1
at all he never 1
was over And yet 1
the night For what 1
a dream When Syme 1
moment empty Then he 1
dead one Directly outside 1
behind him About a 1
post itself The tall 1
were black the face 1
as dark Only a 1
poet Gregory He had 1
his foe He made 1
About what asked Syme 1
weak wonder Gregory struck 1
and anarchy There is 1
and barren and there 1
the lamp I wonder 1
the tree Then after 1
for ever The silence 1
something serious Gregory began 1
rather remarkable You did 1
doing it The captain 1
at Southend You have 1
it out If I 1
it out There is 1
I choose I am 1
neglected truth Gregory stared 1
me serious You think 1
occasional truths You do 1
am serious Syme struck 1
Good Lord is this 1
street serious Are these 1
lanterns serious Is the 1
caboodle serious One comes 1
or religion Syme stood 1
a religion Is it 1
the police Will you 1
swear that If you 1
in return inquired Syme 1
entertaining evening Syme suddenly 1
be declined You say 1
an anarchist I disagree 1
a sportsman Permit me 1

a cab He gave 1
the road The two 1
in silence Gregory gave 1
the river The cab 1
his companion They seated 1
wooden leg The room 1
little supper asked Gregory 1
the game Syme received 1
a joke Accepting the 1
lobster mayonnaise To his 1
Certainly sir and went 1
you drink resumed Gregory 1
menthe myself I have 1
be trusted Do let 1
Thank you said the 1
very good His further 1
the lobster Syme tasted 1
particularly good Then he 1
rather obviously he said 1
like this It is 1
a lobster It is 1
your existence Ah here 1
your champagne I admit 1
unpretentious exterior But that 1
our modesty We are 1
are we asked Syme 1
answered Gregory Then after 1
the champagne I don 1
either condition May I 1
of mine Syme took 1
of smoke It is 1
of screw How simple 1
that is The next 1
swallowed them They went 1
the bottom But when 1

The Man Who Was 0
Thursday by G K 0
Chesterton 1908 To Edmund 0
A cloud was on 0
the mind of men 0
and wailing went the 0
weather Yea a sick 0
cloud upon the soul 0
when we were boys 0
Science announced nonentity and 0
The world was old 0
and ended but you 0
and I were gay 0
Round us in antic 0
order their crippled vices 0
came Lust that had 0
lost its laughter fear 0
that had lost its 0
Like the white lock 0
of Whistler that lit 0
our aimless gloom Men 0
showed their own white 0
feather as proudly as 0
Life was a fly 0
that faded and death 0
a drone that stung 0
The world was very 0
old indeed when you 0
and I were young 0
They twisted even decent 0
sin to shapes not 0
to be named Men 0
were ashamed of honour 0
but we were not 0
Weak if we were 0
and foolish not thus 0
we failed not thus 0
When that black Baal 0
blocked the heavens he 0
had no hymns from 0
us Children we were 0
our forts of sand 0
were even as weak 0
as eve High as 0
they went we piled 0
them up to break 0
Fools as we were 0
in motley all jangling 0
and absurd When all 0
church bells were silent 0
our cap and beds 0
Not all unhelped we 0
held the fort our 0
Some giants laboured in 0
that cloud to lift 0
it from the world 0
I find again the 0
book we found I 0
feel the hour that 0
flings Far out of 0
fish shaped Paumanok some 0
cry of cleaner things 0
And the Green Carnation 0
withered as in forest 0
fires that pass Roared 0
in the wind of 0
all the world ten 0
million leaves of grass 0
Or sane and sweet 0
and sudden as a 0
bird sings in the 0
rain Truth out of 0
Tusitala spoke and pleasure 0
Yea cool and clear 0
and sudden as a 0
bird sings in the 0
grey Dunedin to Samoa 0
spoke and darkness unto 0
But we were young 0
we lived to see 0
God break their bitter 0
God and the good 0
Republic come riding back 0
in arms We have 0
seen the City of 0
Mansoul even as it 0
rocked relieved Blessed are 0
they who did not 0
see but being blind 0
This is a tale 0
of those old fears 0
even of those emptied 0
hells And none but 0
you shall understand the 0
true thing that it 0
tells Of what colossal 0
gods of shame could 0
cow men and yet 0
crash Of what huge 0
devils hid the stars 0
yet fell at a 0
The doubts that were 0
so plain to chase 0
so dreadful to withstand 0
Oh who shall understand 0
yea who shall understand 0
The doubts that drove 0
us through the night 0
as we two talked 0
amain And day had 0
broken on the streets 0
e er it broke 0
Between us by the 0
peace of God such 0
truth can now be 0
Yea there is strength 0
in striking root and 0
good in growing old 0

things at last and 0
marriage and a creed 0

G K C CHAPTER 0
I THE TWO POETS 0
THE suburb of Saffron 0
Park lay on the 0
sunset side of London 0
as red and ragged 0
as a cloud of 0
It was built of 0
a bright brick throughout 0
its sky line was 0
fantastic and even its 0
ground plan was wild 0
It had been the 0
outburst of a speculative 0
builder faintly tinged with 0
art who called its 0
architecture sometimes Elizabethan and 0
sometimes Queen Anne apparently 0
under the impression that 0
the two sovereigns were 0
It was described with 0
some justice as an 0
artistic colony though it 0
never in any definable 0
way produced any art 0
But although its pretensions 0
to be an intellectual 0
centre were a little 0
vague its pretensions to 0
be a pleasant place 0
The stranger who looked 0
for the first time 0
at the quaint red 0
houses could only think 0
how very oddly shaped 0
the people must be 0
who could fit in 0
Nor when he met 0
the people was he 0
disappointed in this respect 0
The place was not 0
only pleasant but perfect 0
if once he could 0
regard it not as 0
a deception but rather 0
Even if the people 0
were not artists the 0
whole was nevertheless artistic 0
That young man with 0
the long auburn hair 0
and the impudent face 0
that young man was 0
not really a poet 0
but surely he was 0
That old gentleman with 0
the wild white beard 0
and the wild white 0
hat that venerable humbug 0
was not really a 0
but at least he 0
was the cause of 0
That scientific gentleman with 0
the bald egg like 0
head and the bare 0
bird like neck had 0
no real right to 0
the airs of science 0
He had not discovered 0
anything new in biology 0
but what biological creature 0
could he have discovered 0
more singular than himself 0
Thus and thus only 0
the whole place had 0
properly to be regarded 0
it had to be 0
considered not so much 0
as a workshop for 0
artists but as a 0
frail but finished work 0
A man who stepped 0
into its social atmosphere 0
felt as if he 0
had stepped into a 0
More especially this attractive 0
unreality fell upon it 0
about nightfall when the 0
extravagant roofs were dark 0
against the afterglow and 0
the whole insane village 0
seemed as separate as 0
This again was more 0
strongly true of the 0
many nights of local 0
festivity when the little 0
gardens were often illuminated 0
and the big Chinese 0
lanterns glowed in the 0
dwarfish trees like some 0
fierce and monstrous fruit 0
And this was strongest 0
of all on one 0
particular evening still vaguely 0
remembered in the locality 0
of which the auburn 0
haired poet was the 0
It was not by 0
any means the only 0
evening of which he 0
On many nights those 0
passing by his little 0
back garden might hear 0
his high didactic voice 0
laying down the law 0
to men and particularly 0
The attitude of women 0
in such cases was 0
indeed one of the 0
paradoxes of the place 0
Most of the women 0
were of the kind 0
vaguely called emancipated and 0
professed some protest against 0
Yet these new women 0
would always pay to 0
a man the extravagant 0
compliment which no ordinary 0
woman ever pays to 0
him that of listening 0
while he is talking 0
And Mr Lucian Gregory 0
the red haired poet 0
a man worth listening 0
to even if one 0
only laughed at the 0
He put the old 0
cant of the lawlessness 0
of art and the 0
art of lawlessness with 0
a certain impudent freshness 0
which gave at least 0
He was helped in 0
some degree by the 0
arresting oddity of his 0
appearance which he worked 0
as the phrase goes 0
for all it was 0
His dark red hair 0
parted in the middle 0
was literally like a 0
woman s and curved 0
into the slow curls 0
of a virgin in 0
a pre Raphaelite picture 0
From within this almost 0
saintly oval however his 0
face projected suddenly broad 0
and brutal the chin 0
carried forward with a 0
look of cockney contempt 0
This combination at once 0
tickled and terrified the 0
nerves of a neurotic 0
He seemed like a 0
walking blasphemy a blend 0
of the angel and 0
This particular evening if 0
it is remembered for 0
nothing else will be 0
remembered in that place 0
for its strange sunset 0
It looked like the 0
end of the world 0
All the heaven seemed 0
covered with a quite 0
vivid and palpable plumage 0
you could only say 0
that the sky was 0
full of feathers and 0
of feathers that almost 0
Across the great part 0
of the dome they 0
were grey with the 0
strangest tints of violet 0
and mauve and an 0
unnatural pink or pale 0
but towards the west 0
the whole grew past 0
description transparent and passionate 0
and the last red 0
hot plumes of it 0
covered up the sun 0
like something too good 0
The whole was so 0
close about the earth 0
as to express nothing 0
but a violent secrecy 0
The very empyrean seemed 0
to be a secret 0
It expressed that splendid 0
smallness which is the 0
soul of local patriotism 0
The very sky seemed 0
I say that there 0
are some inhabitants who 0
may remember the evening 0
if only by that 0
There are others who 0
may remember it because 0
it marked the first 0
appearance in the place 0
of the second poet 0
For a long time 0
the red haired revolutionary 0
had reigned without a 0
it was upon the 0
night of the sunset 0
that his solitude suddenly 0
The new poet who 0
introduced himself by the 0
name of Gabriel Syme 0
was a very mild 0
looking mortal with a 0
fair pointed beard and 0
But an impression grew 0
that he was less 0
meek than he looked 0
He signalised his entrance 0
by differing with the 0
established poet Gregory upon 0
the whole nature of 0
He said that he 0
was poet of law 0
a poet of order 0
nay he said he 0
was a poet of 0
So all the Saffron 0
Parkers looked at him 0
as if he had 0
that moment fallen out 0
of that impossible sky 0
In fact Mr Lucian 0
Gregory the anarchic poet 0
connected the two events 0
It may well be 0
he said in his 0
sudden lyrical manner it 0
may well be on 0
such a night of 0
clouds and cruel colours 0
that there is brought 0
forth upon the earth 0
such a portent as 0
You say you are 0
a poet of law 0
I say you are 0
a contradiction in terms 0
I only wonder there 0
were not comets and 0
earthquakes on the night 0
you appeared in this 0
The man with the 0
meek blue eyes and 0
the pale pointed beard 0
endured these thunders with 0
a certain submissive solemnity 0
The third party of 0
the group Gregory s 0
sister Rosamond who had 0
her brother s braids 0
of red hair but 0
a kindlier face underneath 0
them laughed with such 0
mixture of admiration and 0
disapproval as she gave 0
commonly to the family 0
Gregory resumed in high 0
An artist is identical 0
with an anarchist he 0
You might transpose the 0
An anarchist is an 0
The man who throws 0
a bomb is an 0
artist because he prefers 0
a great moment to 0
He sees how much 0
more valuable is one 0
burst of blazing light 0
one peal of perfect 0
thunder than the mere 0
common bodies of a 0
An artist disregards all 0
governments abolishes all conventions 0
The poet delights in 0
If it were not 0
so the most poetical 0
thing in the world 0
would be the Underground 0
So it is said 0
said Gregory who was 0
very rational when anyone 0
Why do all the 0
clerks and navvies in 0
the railway trains look 0
so sad and tired 0
so very sad and 0
I will tell you 0
It is because they 0
know that the train 0
It is because they 0
know that whatever place 0
they have taken a 0
ticket for that place 0
It is because after 0
they have passed Sloane 0
Square they know that 0
the next station must 0
be Victoria and nothing 0
Oh their wild rapture 0
oh their eyes like 0
stars and their souls 0
again in Eden if 0
the next station were 0
It is you who 0
are unpoetical replied the 0
If what you say 0
of clerks is true 0
they can only be 0
as prosaic as your 0
The rare strange thing 0
is to hit the 0
the gross obvious thing 0
is to miss it 0
We feel it is 0
epical when man with 0
one wild arrow strikes 0
Is it not also 0
epical when man with 0
one wild engine strikes 0
because in chaos the 0
train might indeed go 0
anywhere to Baker Street 0
But man is a 0
magician and his whole 0
magic is in this 0
that he does say 0
No take your books 0
of mere poetry and 0
let me read a 0
time table with tears 0
Take your Byron who 0
commemorates the defeats of 0
give me Bradshaw who 0
Give me Bradshaw I 0
I tell you went 0
on Syme with passion 0
that every time a 0
train comes in I 0
feel that it has 0
broken past batteries of 0
besiegers and that man 0
has won a battle 0
You say contemptuously that 0
when one has left 0
Sloane Square one must 0
I say that one 0
might do a thousand 0
things instead and that 0
whenever I really come 0
there I have the 0
sense of hairbreadth escape 0
And when I hear 0
the guard shout out 0
the word Victoria it 0
is not an unmeaning 0
It is to me 0
the cry of a 0
It is to me 0
it is the victory 0
Gregory wagged his heavy 0
red head with a 0
slow and sad smile 0
And even then he 0
said we poets always 0
ask the question And 0
what is Victoria now 0
that you have got 0
You think Victoria is 0
like the New Jerusalem 0
We know that the 0
New Jerusalem will only 0
Yes the poet will 0
be discontented even in 0
the streets of heaven 0
The poet is always 0
There again said Syme 0
irritably what is there 0
poetical about being in 0
You might as well 0
say that it is 0
poetical to be sea 0
Being sick is a 0
Both being sick and 0
being rebellious may be 0
the wholesome thing on 0
but I m hanged 0
if I can see 0
why they are poetical 0
Revolt in the abstract 0
It s mere vomiting 0
The girl winced for 0
a flash at the 0
unpleasant word but Syme 0
was too hot to 0
It is things going 0
right he cried that 0
is poetical I Our 0
digestions for instance going 0
sacredly and silently right 0
that is the foundation 0
Yes the most poetical 0
thing more poetical than 0
the flowers more poetical 0
than the stars the 0
most poetical thing in 0
the world is not 0
Really said Gregory superciliously 0
the examples you choose 0
I beg your pardon 0
said Syme grimly I 0
forgot we had abolished 0
For the first time 0
a red patch appeared 0
on Gregory s forehead 0
You don t expect 0
me he said to 0
revolutionise society on this 0
Syme looked straight into 0
his eyes and smiled 0
No I don t 0
but I suppose that 0
if you were serious 0
about your anarchism that 0
is exactly what you 0
Gregory s big bull 0
s eyes blinked suddenly 0
like those of an 0
angry lion and one 0
could almost fancy that 0
his red mane rose 0
Don t you think 0
then he said in 0
a dangerous voice that 0
I am serious about 0
I beg your pardon 0
Am I not serious 0
cried Gregory with knotted 0
said Syme and strolled 0
With surprise but with 0
a curious pleasure he 0
found Rosamond Gregory still 0
Mr Syme she said 0
do the people who 0
talk like you and 0
my brother often mean 0
Do you mean what 0
What do you mean 0
asked the girl with 0
My dear Miss Gregory 0
said Syme gently there 0
are many kinds of 0
When you say thank 0
you for the salt 0
do you mean what 0
When you say the 0
world is round do 0
you mean what you 0
It is true but 0
you don t mean 0
Now sometimes a man 0
like your brother really 0
finds a thing he 0
It may be only 0
a half truth quarter 0
but then he says 0
more than he means 0
from sheer force of 0
She was looking at 0
him from under level 0
her face was grave 0
and open and there 0
had fallen upon it 0
the shadow of that 0
unreasoning responsibility which is 0
at the bottom of 0
the most frivolous woman 0
the maternal watch which 0
is as old as 0
Is he really an 0
Only in that sense 0
I speak of replied 0
or if you prefer 0
it in that nonsense 0
She drew her broad 0
brows together and said 0
He wouldn t really 0
use bombs or that 0
Syme broke into a 0
great laugh that seemed 0
too large for his 0
slight and somewhat dandified 0
he said that has 0
to be done anonymously 0
And at that the 0
corners of her own 0
mouth broke into a 0
smile and she thought 0
with a simultaneous pleasure 0
of Gregory s absurdity 0
and of his safety 0
Syme strolled with her 0
to a seat in 0
the corner of the 0
garden and continued to 0
pour out his opinions 0
For he was a 0
sincere man and in 0
spite of his superficial 0
airs and graces at 0
root a humble one 0
And it is always 0
the humble man who 0
the proud man watches 0
He defended respectability with 0
He grew passionate in 0
his praise of tidiness 0
All the time there 0
was a smell of 0
lilac all round him 0
Once he heard very 0
faintly in some distant 0
street a barrel organ 0
begin to play and 0
it seemed to him 0
that his heroic words 0
were moving to a 0
tiny tune from under 0
or beyond the world 0
He stared and talked 0
at the girl s 0
red hair and amused 0
face for what seemed 0
to be a few 0
and then feeling that 0
the groups in such 0
a place should mix 0
rose to his feet 0
To his astonishment he 0
discovered the whole garden 0
Everyone had gone long 0
ago and he went 0
himself with a rather 0
He left with a 0
sense of champagne in 0
his head which he 0
could not afterwards explain 0
In the wild events 0
which were to follow 0
this girl had no 0
he never saw her 0
again until all his 0
And yet in some 0
indescribable way she kept 0
recurring like a motive 0
in music through all 0
his mad adventures afterwards 0
and the glory of 0
her strange hair ran 0
like a red thread 0
through those dark and 0
ill drawn tapestries of 0
For what followed was 0
so improbable that it 0
might well have been 0
When Syme went out 0
into the starlit street 0
he found it for 0
in some odd way 0
that the silence was 0
rather a living silence 0
than a dead one 0
Directly outside the door 0
stood a street lamp 0
whose gleam gilded the 0
leaves of the tree 0
that bent out over 0
the fence behind him 0
About a foot from 0
the lamp post stood 0
a figure almost as 0
rigid and motionless as 0
the lamp post itself 0
The tall hat and 0
long frock coat were 0
the face in an 0
abrupt shadow was almost 0
Only a fringe of 0
fiery hair against the 0
light and also something 0
aggressive in the attitude 0
proclaimed that it was 0
He had something of 0
the look of a 0
masked bravo waiting sword 0
in hand for his 0
He made a sort 0
of doubtful salute which 0
Syme somewhat more formally 0
I was waiting for 0
Might I have a 0
asked Syme in a 0
sort of weak wonder 0
Gregory struck out with 0
his stick at the 0
lamp post and then 0
About this and this 0
about order and anarchy 0
There is your precious 0
order that lean iron 0
lamp ugly and barren 0
and there is anarchy 0
rich living reproducing itself 0
there is anarchy splendid 0
in green and gold 0
All the same replied 0
Syme patiently just at 0
present you only see 0
the tree by the 0
light of the lamp 0
I wonder when you 0
would ever see the 0
lamp by the light 0
Then after a pause 0
he said But may 0
I ask if you 0
have been standing out 0
here in the dark 0
only to resume our 0
No cried out Gregory 0
in a voice that 0
rang down the street 0
I did not stand 0
here to resume our 0
argument but to end 0
The silence fell again 0
and Syme though he 0
understood nothing listened instinctively 0
Gregory began in a 0
smooth voice and with 0
a rather bewildering smile 0
Mr Syme he said 0
this evening you succeeded 0
in doing something rather 0
You did something to 0
me that no man 0
born of woman has 0
ever succeeded in doing 0
Now I remember resumed 0
Gregory reflectively one other 0
person succeeded in doing 0
The captain of a 0
if I remember correctly 0
You have irritated me 0
I am very sorry 0
replied Syme with gravity 0
I am afraid my 0
fury and your insult 0
are too shocking to 0
be wiped out even 0
with an apology said 0
No duel could wipe 0
If I struck you 0
dead I could not 0
There is only one 0
way by which that 0
insult can be erased 0
and that way I 0
I am going at 0
the possible sacrifice of 0
my life and honour 0
to prove to you 0
that you were wrong 0
in what you said 0
In what I said 0
You said I was 0
not serious about being 0
There are degrees of 0
I have never doubted 0
that you were perfectly 0
sincere in this sense 0
that you thought what 0
you said well worth 0
saying that you thought 0
a paradox might wake 0
men up to a 0
Gregory stared at him 0
And in no other 0
sense he asked you 0
You think me a 0
flaneur who lets fall 0
You do not think 0
that in a deeper 0
a more deadly sense 0
Syme struck his stick 0
violently on the stones 0
is this street serious 0
Are these damned Chinese 0
Is the whole caboodle 0
One comes here and 0
talks a pack of 0
bosh and perhaps some 0
sense as well but 0
I should think very 0
little of a man 0
who didn t keep 0
something in the background 0
of his life that 0
was more serious than 0
all this talking something 0
more serious whether it 0
was religion or only 0
Very well said Gregory 0
his face darkening you 0
shall see something more 0
serious than either drink 0
Syme stood waiting with 0
his usual air of 0
mildness until Gregory again 0
You spoke just now 0
of having a religion 0
Is it really true 0
that you have one 0
Oh said Syme with 0
a beaming smile we 0
are all Catholics now 0
Then may I ask 0
you to swear by 0
whatever gods or saints 0
your religion involves that 0
you will not reveal 0
what I am now 0
going to tell you 0
to any son of 0
Adam and especially not 0
Will you swear that 0
If you will take 0
upon yourself this awful 0
abnegations if you will 0
consent to burden your 0
soul with a vow 0
that you should never 0
make and a knowledge 0
you should never dream 0
about I will promise 0
You will promise me 0
inquired Syme as the 0
I will promise you 0
a very entertaining evening 0
Syme suddenly took off 0
Your offer he said 0
is far too idiotic 0
You say that a 0
poet is always an 0
but I hope at 0
least that he is 0
Permit me here and 0
now to swear as 0
a Christian and promise 0
as a good comrade 0
and a fellow artist 0
that I will not 0
report anything of this 0
whatever it is to 0
And now in the 0
name of Colney Hatch 0
I think said Gregory 0
with placid irrelevancy that 0
we will call a 0
He gave two long 0
whistles and a hansom 0
came rattling down the 0
The two got into 0
Gregory gave through the 0
trap the address of 0
an obscure public house 0
on the Chiswick bank 0
The cab whisked itself 0
away again and in 0
it these two fantastics 0
quitted their fantastic town 0
CHAPTER II THE SECRET 0
THE cab pulled up 0
before a particularly dreary 0
and greasy beershop into 0
which Gregory rapidly conducted 0
They seated themselves in 0
a close and dim 0
sort of bar parlour 0
at a stained wooden 0
table with one wooden 0
The room was so 0
small and dark that 0
very little could be 0
seen of the attendant 0
who was summoned beyond 0
a vague and dark 0
impression of something bulky 0
Will you take a 0
The pate de foie 0
gras is not good 0
here but I can 0
Syme received the remark 0
with stolidity imagining it 0
to be a joke 0
Accepting the vein of 0
humour he said with 0
a well bred indifference 0
Oh bring me some 0
To his indescribable astonishment 0
the man only said 0
and went away apparently 0
What will you drink 0
resumed Gregory with the 0
same careless yet apologetic 0
I shall only have 0
a crepe de menthe 0
But the champagne can 0
Do let me start 0
you with a half 0
bottle of Pommery at 0
said the motionless Syme 0
You are very good 0
His further attempts at 0
conversation somewhat disorganised in 0
themselves were cut short 0
finally as by a 0
thunderbolt by the actual 0
appearance of the lobster 0
Syme tasted it and 0
found it particularly good 0
Then he suddenly began 0
to eat with great 0
Excuse me if I 0
enjoy myself rather obviously 0
he said to Gregory 0
I don t often 0
have the luck to 0
have a dream like 0
It is new to 0
me for a nightmare 0
to lead to a 0
It is commonly the 0
You are not asleep 0
I assure you said 0
You are on the 0
contrary close to the 0
most actual and rousing 0
moment of your existence 0
Ah here comes your 0
I admit that there 0
may be a slight 0
disproportion let us say 0
between the inner arrangements 0
of this excellent hotel 0
and its simple and 0
But that is all 0
We are the most 0
modest men that ever 0
And who are we 0
asked Syme emptying his 0
It is quite simple 0
We are the serious 0
anarchists in whom you 0
You do yourselves well 0
Yes we are serious 0
about everything answered Gregory 0
Then after a pause 0
If in a few 0
moments this table begins 0
to turn round a 0
little don t put 0
it down to your 0
inroads into the champagne 0
I don t wish 0
you to do yourself 0
Well if I am 0
not drunk I am 0
mad replied Syme with 0
but I trust I 0
can behave like a 0
gentleman in either condition 0
said Gregory producing a 0
Try one of mine 0
Syme took the cigar 0
clipped the end off 0
with a cigar cutter 0
out of his waistcoat 0
pocket put it in 0
his mouth lit it 0
slowly and let out 0
a long cloud of 0
It is not a 0
little to his credit 0
that he performed these 0
rites with so much 0
composure for almost before 0
he had begun them 0
the table at which 0
he sat had begun 0
to revolve first slowly 0
and then rapidly as 0
if at an insane 0
You must not mind 0
it s a kind 0
Quite so said Syme 0
placidly a kind of 0
How simple that is 0
The next moment the 0
smoke of his cigar 0
which had been wavering 0
across the room in 0
snaky twists went straight 0
up as if from 0
a factory chimney and 0
the two with their 0
chairs and table shot 0
down through the floor 0
as if the earth 0
They went rattling down 0
a kind of roaring 0
chimney as rapidly as 0
a lift cut loose 0
and they came with 0
an abrupt bump to 0
But when Gregory threw 0
open a pair of 0
doors and let in 0
a red subterranean light 0
Syme was still smoking 0
with one leg thrown 0
over the other and 0
had not turned a 0
Gregory led him down 0
a low vaulted passage 0
at the end of 0
which was the red 0
It was an enormous 0
crimson lantern nearly as 0
big as a fireplace 0
fixed over a small 0
but heavy iron door 0
In the door there 0
was a sort of 0
hatchway or grating and 0
on this Gregory struck 0
A heavy voice with 0
a foreign accent asked 0
him who he was 0
To this he gave 0
the more or less 0
unexpected reply Mr Joseph 0
The heavy hinges began 0
it was obviously some 0
Inside the doorway the 0
passage gleamed as if 0
it were lined with 0
a network of steel 0
On a second glance 0
Syme saw that the 0
glittering pattern was really 0
made up of ranks 0
and ranks of rifles 0
and revolvers closely packed 0
I must ask you 0
to forgive me all 0
these formalities said Gregory 0
we have to be 0
Oh don t apologise 0
I know your passion 0
for law and order 0
and he stepped into 0
the passage lined with 0
With his long fair 0
hair and rather foppish 0
frock coat he looked 0
a singularly frail and 0
fanciful figure as he 0
walked down that shining 0
They passed through several 0
such passages and came 0
out at last into 0
a queer steel chamber 0
with curved walls almost 0
spherical in shape but 0
presenting with its tiers 0
of benches something of 0
the appearance of a 0
There were no rifles 0
or pistols in this 0
apartment but round the 0
walls of it were 0
hung more dubious and 0
dreadful shapes things that 0
looked like the bulbs 0
of iron plants or 0
the eggs of iron 0
They were bombs and 0
the very room itself 0
seemed like the inside 0
Syme knocked his cigar 0
ash off against the 0
wall and went in 0
And now my dear 0
Mr Syme said Gregory 0
throwing himself in an 0
expansive manner on the 0
bench under the largest 0
bomb now we are 0
quite cosy so let 0
Now no human words 0
can give you any 0
notion of why I 0
It was one of 0
those quite arbitrary emotions 0
like jumping off a 0
cliff or falling in 0
Suffice it to say 0
that you were an 0
inexpressibly irritating fellow and 0
to do you justice 0
I would break twenty 0
oaths of secrecy for 0
the pleasure of taking 0
you down a peg 0
That way you have 0
of lighting a cigar 0
would make a priest 0
break the seal of 0
Well you said that 0
you were quite certain 0
I was not a 0
Does this place strike 0
you as being serious 0
It does seem to 0
have a moral under 0
all its gaiety assented 0
but may I ask 0
You need not fear 0
to give me information 0
because as you remember 0
you very wisely extorted 0
from me a promise 0
not to tell the 0
police a promise I 0
So it is in 0
mere curiosity that I 0
First of all what 0
is it really all 0
What is it you 0
You want to abolish 0
said Gregory opening the 0
eyes of a fanatic 0
We do not only 0
want to upset a 0
few despotisms and police 0
that sort of anarchism 0
does exist but it 0
is a mere branch 0
We dig deeper and 0
we blow you higher 0
We wish to deny 0
all those arbitrary distinctions 0
of vice and virtue 0
honour and treachery upon 0
which mere rebels base 0
The silly sentimentalists of 0
the French Revolution talked 0
of the Rights of 0
We hate Rights as 0
We have abolished Right 0
And Right and Left 0
said Syme with a 0
simple eagerness I hope 0
you will abolish them 0
They are much more 0
You spoke of a 0
second question snapped Gregory 0
With pleasure resumed Syme 0
In all your present 0
acts and surroundings there 0
is a scientific attempt 0
I have an aunt 0
who lived over a 0
shop but this is 0
the first time I 0
have found people living 0
from preference under a 0
You have a heavy 0
You cannot pass it 0
without submitting to the 0
humiliation of calling yourself 0
You surround yourself with 0
steel instruments which make 0
the place if I 0
may say so more 0
May I ask why 0
after taking all this 0
trouble to barricade yourselves 0
in the bowels of 0
the earth you then 0
parade your whole secret 0
by talking about anarchism 0
to every silly woman 0
The answer is simple 0
I told you I 0
was a serious anarchist 0
and you did not 0
Nor do they believe 0
Unless I took them 0
into this infernal room 0
they would not believe 0
Syme smoked thoughtfully and 0
looked at him with 0
The history of the 0
thing might amuse you 0
When first I became 0
one of the New 0
Anarchists I tried all 0
kinds of respectable disguises 0
I dressed up as 0
I read up all 0
about bishops in our 0
anarchist pamphlets in Superstition 0
the Vampire and Priests 0
I certainly understood from 0
them that bishops are 0
strange and terrible old 0
men keeping a cruel 0
When on my first 0
appearing in episcopal gaiters 0
in a drawing room 0
I cried out in 0
a voice of thunder 0
they found out in 0
some way that I 0
was not a bishop 0
I was nabbed at 0
Then I made up 0
but I defended Capital 0
with so much intelligence 0
that a fool could 0
see that I was 0
Then I tried being 0
Now I am a 0
humanitarian myself but I 0
have I hope enough 0
intellectual breadth to understand 0
the position of those 0
who like Nietzsche admire 0
violence the proud mad 0
war of Nature and 0
all that you know 0
I threw myself into 0
I drew my sword 0
and waved it constantly 0
I called out Blood 0
abstractedly like a man 0
I often said Let 0
it is the Law 0
Well well it seems 0
majors don t do 0
I was nabbed again 0
At last I went 0
in despair to the 0
President of the Central 0
Anarchist Council who is 0
the greatest man in 0
What is his name 0
You would not know 0
That is his greatness 0
Caesar and Napoleon put 0
all their genius into 0
being heard of and 0
they were heard of 0
He puts all his 0
genius into not being 0
heard of and he 0
is not heard of 0
But you cannot be 0
for five minutes in 0
the room with him 0
without feeling that Caesar 0
and Napoleon would have 0
been children in his 0
He was silent and 0
even pale for a 0
moment and then resumed 0
But whenever he gives 0
advice it is always 0
something as startling as 0
an epigram and yet 0
as practical as the 0
I said to him 0
What disguise will hide 0
me from the world 0
What can I find 0
more respectable than bishops 0
He looked at me 0
with his large but 0
You want a safe 0
You want a dress 0
which will guarantee you 0
a dress in which 0
no one would ever 0
look for a bomb 0
He suddenly lifted his 0
Why then dress up 0
as an anarchist you 0
he roared so that 0
Nobody will ever expect 0
you to do anything 0
And he turned his 0
broad back on me 0
I took his advice 0
and have never regretted 0
I preached blood and 0
murder to those women 0
day and night and 0
would let me wheel 0
Syme sat watching him 0
with some respect in 0
his large blue eyes 0
You took me in 0
It is really a 0
Then after a pause 0
What do you call 0
this tremendous President of 0
We generally call him 0
Sunday replied Gregory with 0
You see there are 0
seven members of the 0
Central Anarchist Council and 0
they are named after 0
days of the week 0
He is called Sunday 0
by some of his 0
It is curious you 0
should mention the matter 0
because the very night 0
you have dropped in 0
if I may so 0
is the night on 0
which our London branch 0
which assembles in this 0
room has to elect 0
its own deputy to 0
fill a vacancy in 0
The gentleman who has 0
for some time past 0
played with propriety and 0
general applause the difficult 0
part of Thursday has 0
Consequently we have called 0
a meeting this very 0
evening to elect a 0
He got to his 0
feet and strolled across 0
the room with a 0
sort of smiling embarrassment 0
I feel somehow as 0
if you were my 0
mother Syme he continued 0
I feel that I 0
can confide anything to 0
you as you have 0
promised to tell nobody 0
In fact I will 0
confide to you something 0
that I would not 0
say in so many 0
words to the anarchists 0
who will be coming 0
to the room in 0
We shall of course 0
go through a form 0
but I don t 0
mind telling you that 0
it is practically certain 0
what the result will 0
He looked down for 0
It is almost a 0
settled thing that I 0
am to be Thursday 0
said Syme heartily I 0
Gregory smiled in deprecation 0
and walked across the 0
As a matter of 0
fact everything is ready 0
for me on this 0
table he said and 0
the ceremony will probably 0
be the shortest possible 0
Syme also strolled across 0
to the table and 0
found lying across it 0
a walking stick which 0
turned out on examination 0
to be a sword 0
stick a large Colt 0
s revolver a sandwich 0
case and a formidable 0
Over the chair beside 0
the table was thrown 0
a heavy looking cape 0
I have only to 0
get the form of 0
election finished continued Gregory 0
with animation then I 0
snatch up this cloak 0
and stick stuff these 0
other things into my 0
pocket step out of 0
a door in this 0
cavern which opens on 0
the river where there 0
is a steam tug 0
already waiting for me 0
and then then oh 0
the wild joy of 0
And he clasped his 0
Syme who had sat 0
down once more with 0
his usual insolent languor 0
got to his feet 0
with an unusual air 0
Why is it he 0
asked vaguely that I 0
think you are quite 0
Why do I positively 0
He paused a moment 0
and then added with 0
a sort of fresh 0
curiosity Is it because 0
you are such an 0
There was a thoughtful 0
silence again and then 0
Well damn it all 0
this is the funniest 0
situation I have ever 0
been in in my 0
life and I am 0
going to act accordingly 0
Gregory I gave you 0
a promise before I 0
came into this place 0
That promise I would 0
keep under red hot 0
Would you give me 0
for my own safety 0
a little promise of 0
Yes said Syme very 0
I swore before God 0
that I would not 0
tell your secret to 0
Will you swear by 0
Humanity or whatever beastly 0
thing you believe in 0
that you will not 0
tell my secret to 0
asked the staring Gregory 0
Have you got a 0
Yes said Syme I 0
Then after a pause 0
Gregory glared at him 0
gravely for a few 0
moments and then said 0
You must have bewitched 0
me but I feel 0
a furious curiosity about 0
Yes I will swear 0
not to tell the 0
anarchists anything you tell 0
But look sharp for 0
they will be here 0
in a couple of 0
Syme rose slowly to 0
his feet and thrust 0
his long white hands 0
into his long grey 0
Almost as he did 0
so there came five 0
knocks on the outer 0
grating proclaiming the arrival 0
of the first of 0
Well said Syme slowly 0
I don t know 0
how to tell you 0
the truth more shortly 0
than by saying that 0
your expedient of dressing 0
up as an aimless 0
poet is not confined 0
to you or your 0
We have known the 0
dodge for some time 0
Gregory tried to spring 0
up straight but he 0
What do you say 0
he asked in an 0
Yes said Syme simply 0
I am a police 0
But I think I 0
hear your friends coming 0
From the doorway there 0
came a murmur of 0
It was repeated twice 0
and thrice and then 0
thirty times and the 0
crowd of Joseph Chamberlains 0
could be heard trampling 0
