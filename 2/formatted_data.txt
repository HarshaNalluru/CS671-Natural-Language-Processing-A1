its shame Like the 1
a plume Life was 1
that stung The world 1
were young They twisted 1
of honour but we 1
not ashamed Weak if 1
not thus When that 1
bitter sea Fools as 1

of sunset It was 1
brick throughout its sky 1
was wild It had 1
were identical It was 1
any art But although 1
quite indisputable The stranger 1
to them Nor when 1
this respect The place 1
a dream Even if 1
nevertheless artistic That young 1
a poet but surely 1
a poem That old 1
a philosopher but at 1
in others That scientific 1
he assumed He had 1
in biology but what 1
than himself Thus and 1
be regarded it had 1
of art A man 1
written comedy More especially 1
drifting cloud This again 1
monstrous fruit And this 1
the hero It was 1
the hero On many 1
to women The attitude 1
the place Most of 1
male supremacy Yet these 1

of it He put 1
momentary pleasure He was 1
was worth His dark 1
Raphaelite picture From within 1
cockney contempt This combination 1
neurotic population He seemed 1
the ape This particular 1
strange sunset It looked 1
the world All the 1
palpable plumage you could 1
the face Across the 1
pale green but towards 1
be seen The whole 1
violent secrecy The very 1
a secret It expressed 1
local patriotism The very 1
seemed small I say 1
oppressive sky There are 1
Saffron Park For a 1
a rival it was 1
suddenly ended The new 1
yellow hair But an 1
he looked He signalised 1
of poetry He said 1
of order nay he 1
of respectability So all 1
impossible sky In fact 1
respectable poet You say 1
of law I say 1
in terms I only 1
this garden The man 1
submissive solemnity The third 1
family oracle Gregory resumed 1
words anywhere An anarchist 1
an artist The man 1
to everything He sees 1
shapeless policemen An artist 1
all conventions The poet 1
disorder only If it 1
and tired I will 1
tell you It is 1
going right It is 1
will reach It is 1
but Victoria Oh their 1
wild rapture oh their 1
your poetry The rare 1
the mark the gross 1
miss it We feel 1
distant bird Is it 1
distant station Chaos is 1
to Bagdad But man 1
and lo it is 1
and prose let me 1
of pride Take your 1
of man give me 1
his victories Give me 1
you go inquired Gregory 1
against chaos You say 1
to Victoria I say 1
hairbreadth escape And when 1
unmeaning word It is 1
announcing conquest It is 1
indeed Victoria it is 1
of Adam Gregory wagged 1
got there You think 1
New Jerusalem We know 1
like Victoria Yes the 1
of heaven The poet 1
in revolt You might 1
sea sick Being sick 1
a revolt Both being 1
desperate occasions but I 1
are poetical Revolt in 1
is revolting It s 1
mere vomiting The girl 1
all poetry Yes the 1
all conventions For the 1
this lawn Syme looked 1
would do Gregory s 1
your pardon said Syme 1
my anarchism cried Gregory 1
dear fellow said Syme 1
strolled away With surprise 1
they say Do you 1
say now Syme smiled 1
Do you he asked 1
you mean asked the 1
and insincerity When you 1
mean it Now sometimes 1
does mean It may 1
tenth truth but then 1
meaning it She was 1
level brows her face 1
anarchist then she asked 1
that nonsense She drew 1
of thing Syme broke 1
Lord no he said 1
done anonymously And at 1
his safety Syme strolled 1
his opinions For he 1
humble one And it 1
too much the proud 1
too closely He defended 1
and exaggeration He grew 1
and propriety All the 1
round him Once he 1
the world He stared 1
few minutes and then 1
his feet To his 1
garden empty Everyone had 1
hurried apology He left 1
afterwards explain In the 1
at all he never 1
was over And yet 1
the night For what 1
a dream When Syme 1
moment empty Then he 1
dead one Directly outside 1
behind him About a 1
post itself The tall 1
were black the face 1
as dark Only a 1
poet Gregory He had 1
his foe He made 1
About what asked Syme 1
weak wonder Gregory struck 1
and anarchy There is 1
and barren and there 1
the lamp I wonder 1
the tree Then after 1
for ever The silence 1
something serious Gregory began 1
rather remarkable You did 1
doing it The captain 1
at Southend You have 1
it out If I 1
it out There is 1
I choose I am 1
neglected truth Gregory stared 1
me serious You think 1
occasional truths You do 1
am serious Syme struck 1
Good Lord is this 1
street serious Are these 1
lanterns serious Is the 1
caboodle serious One comes 1
or religion Syme stood 1
a religion Is it 1
the police Will you 1
swear that If you 1
in return inquired Syme 1
entertaining evening Syme suddenly 1
be declined You say 1
an anarchist I disagree 1
a sportsman Permit me 1

a cab He gave 1
the road The two 1
in silence Gregory gave 1
the river The cab 1

wooden leg The room 1

the game Syme received 1
a joke Accepting the 1
lobster mayonnaise To his 1
Certainly sir and went 1

menthe myself I have 1
be trusted Do let 1
Thank you said the 1
very good His further 1
the lobster Syme tasted 1
particularly good Then he 1
rather obviously he said 1
like this It is 1
a lobster It is 1
your existence Ah here 1
your champagne I admit 1
unpretentious exterior But that 1
our modesty We are 1
are we asked Syme 1
answered Gregory Then after 1
the champagne I don 1
either condition May I 1
of mine Syme took 1
of smoke It is 1
of screw How simple 1
that is The next 1
swallowed them They went 1
the bottom But when 1
yellow hair Gregory led 1
red light It was 1
iron door In the 1
five times A heavy 1
he was To this 1
Joseph Chamberlain The heavy 1
to move it was 1

with interest Gregory went 1
respectable disguises I dressed 1
a bishop I read 1
of Prey I certainly 1
from mankind I was 1
human reason they found 1

at once Then I 1
a millionaire but I 1
quite poor Then I 1
a major Now I 1

out Blood abstractedly like 1
for wine I often 1
weak perish it is 1
the Law Well well 1

nabbed again At last 1
his name asked Syme 1
his greatness Caesar and 1
heard of He puts 1

A promise asked Gregory 1
a promise I swore 1

about you Yes I 1

of minutes Syme rose 1
trousers pockets Almost as 1
your President We have 1
Scotland Yard Gregory tried 1

police detective But I 1
friends coming From the 1
Joseph Chamberlain It was 1
from him He was 1
wild beast He caught 1
at Syme Syme did 1
not necessary Don t 1
same boat Yes and 1
sea sick Gregory could 1
each other cried Syme 1

break yours Here are 1
your friends The mass 1
weary gait but one 1
a delegate Gregory taken 1
of Syme but Syme 1
a delegate The brow 1
you represent he asked 1
a Sabbatarian I have 1
of Sunday The little 1
the group Evidently the 1
d better When Gregory 1
painful thought He was 1
of diplomacy It was 1
accidental dilemmas Little was 1
from them He could 1
police station After all 1
of it He would 1
chance it He strode 1
river already I move 1
the chair This being 1
be long This branch 1
European Council We have 1
splendid Thursdays We all 1
last week As you 1
were considerable He organised 1
the pier As you 1
the cow Cruelty or 1
him always But it 1
harder task It is 1
replace them Upon you 1
be Thursday If any 1
the vote If no 1
his innocence There was 1
in church Then a 1
anyone second asked the 1
a statement Gregory rose 1
of applause His face 1
almost scarlet But he 1
at ease He had 1
white road His best 1
after all He believed 1
perfect words He thought 1
delicately false Syme had 1
the fool Could he 1
policy also Our belief 1
been altered Those who 1
fountain head They learn 1
sixpenny novels they learn 1
s newspapers they learn 1
Sporting Times They never 1
from anarchists We have 1
to another The man 1
our reply I know 1
the roof For it 1
the Catacombs But if 1
streets above What tales 1
of history Suppose we 1
the Christians Suppose we 1
as meek The applause 1
stopped suddenly In the 1
not meek Ah how 1
knows himself His words 1
indeed extravagant his appearance 1
to see I repeat 1
too late We are 1
Comrade Witherspoon We are 1
at me We are 1
No no called out 1
were merciful Yet this 1
human flesh We do 1
No no said Witherspoon 1
that body Superbly careless 1
and simplicity Gregory resumed 1
his forehead The silence 1
Comrade Gregory The assembly 1
thick beard By the 1
and carried But as 1
I oppose The most 1
the voice Mr Gabriel 1
understood oratory Having said 1
for this Do we 1
like this This is 1
School treat Do we 1
of society But I 1
not murderers There I 1
with astonishment Now in 1
damnable hypocrite Syme looked 1
of hypocrisy He knows 1
my duty I do 1
mince words I do 1
pretend to I say 1
amiable qualities He is 1
the wall and I 1
for election His sentence 1
of applause The faces 1
delighted cries At the 1
blasted madmen he cried 1
Stop you But louder 1
true prophets I am 1
your prophecies The heavy 1
tell you cried Gregory 1
is all The voice 1
this amendment he said 1
his feet Gregory had 1
time past now there 1
all this he said 1
be elected He is 1
is he Gregory s 1
without sound then slowly 1
down abruptly Before he 1
Comrade Syme Gregory had 1
Oh oh said Mr 1
you like No I 1
for it I will 1
a command Call it 1
upon it Strike but 1
hear me Kill me 1
obey me Do not 1
this man Truth is 1
a reed But you 1
blue eyes He merely 1
Gregory commands Then the 1
are you You are 1
not Sunday and another 1
a slave If you 1
my degradation I kneel 1
to you I throw 1
your feet I implore 1
quite dignified For the 1
real silence Then Gregory 1
General Council The roar 1
of Europe Everyone in 1
the table The instant 1
the room Syme found 1
stunned hatred They were 1
a devil said Gregory 1
to that You made 1
made you Perhaps we 1
think right But what 1
of concession There is 1
this way With a 1
their heels At the 1
a theatre Close to 1
red eye Almost in 1
thank you You have 1
small particular There was 1
you mean cried the 1
a poet he was 1
a detective Nor was 1
anarchy hypocritical He was 1
most revolutionists He had 1
tame tradition His respectability 1
against rebellion He came 1
newest notions One of 1
nothing else His father 1
self realisation his mother 1
and hygiene Hence the 1
healthy dislike The more 1
pagan latitude and by 1
defending cannibalism Being surrounded 1
left sanity But there 1
be sensible His hatred 1
an accident It happened 1
dynamite outrage He had 1
bleeding faces After that 1
rather gentle but there 1
not sane He did 1
with intellectualism He regarded 1
Chinese invasion He poured 1
barbaric denial But he 1
a living As he 1
as he Indeed he 1
the wall He was 1
it otherwise He walked 1
red sunset The red 1
his anger The sky 1
it mirrored It looked 1
subterranean country Syme was 1
those days He wore 1
pot hat he was 1
and ragged and the 1
Bulwer Lytton Also his 1
Saffron Park A long 1
holy war Perhaps this 1
Good evening Syme at 1
is it he said 1
good evening Look at 1
bloody river I tell 1
move on You policemen 1
Board Schools said Syme 1
those advantages The Board 1
my time What education 1
have it asked Syme 1
a policeman The policeman 1
the police asked Syme 1
human will I trust 1
you do But as 1
you do How comes 1
at it We are 1
our enemies But you 1
of mind I think 1
in what asked Syme 1
of civilisation He is 1
the State He has 1
also philosophers It is 1
controversial sense I am 1
or virtue But it 1
heresy hunt Syme s 1
do then he said 1
ordinary detective The ordinary 1
arrest thieves we go 1
detect pessimists The ordinary 1
been committed We discover 1
be committed We have 1
intellectual crime We were 1
brutal business I tell 1
the desperate But this 1
different affair We deny 1
dangerous criminals We remember 1
Roman Emperors We remember 1
the Renaissance We say 1
educated criminal We say 1
modern philosopher Compared to 1
moral men my heart 1
to them They accept 1
of man they merely 1
it wrongly Thieves respect 1
respect it But philosophers 1
as property they wish 1
personal possession Bigamists respect 1
of bigamy But philosophers 1
as marriage Murderers respect 1
human life they merely 1
verbal antithesis The common 1
good man He says 1
praise God He is 1
an anarchist He wishes 1
destroy it But the 1
annihilate them Yes the 1
the unfortunate It has 1
the Church The moderns 1
punish heretics My only 1
is absurd cried the 1
is intolerable I don 1
your life You must 1
against anarchy Their armies 1
our frontiers Their bolt 1
to fall A moment 1
quite understand I know 1
little movements But beastly 1
each other How can 1
one bolt What is 1
mistaken men This is 1
inner ring You might 1
the priesthood I prefer 1
guilty section The outer 1
merely anarchists that is 1
human happiness They believe 1
it crime They do 1
the punishment They believe 1
the crime They believe 1
of spring They believe 1
exquisitely good These I 1
so on And so 1
sacred priesthood They also 1
at last But in 1
horrible meaning They are 1
no illusions they are 1
the struggle And they 1
mean death When they 1
commit suicide When they 1
the grave They have 1
then themselves That is 1
firing pistols The innocent 1
the king but the 1
join you asked Syme 1
have spoken You should 1
see him Or rather 1
sees him but you 1
dark room He says 1
thoughts brighter Do come 1
Scotland Yard Almost before 1
of light It was 1
faintly traced it was 1
new recruit asked a 1
heavy voice And in 1
massive stature and second 1
new recruit said the 1
All right You are 1
other martyrs I am 1
to death Good day 1
great conspiracy Acting under 1
Saffron Park Before he 1
official authority He put 1
of London Where his 1
already seen At about 1
of Anarchists When Syme 1
entirely new not merely 1
new planet This was 1
hours before Every trace 1
naked sky The moon 1
weaker sun It gave 1
dead daylight Over the 1
in eclipse so that 1
sadder star But the 1
great fire Even the 1
to bed The sword 1
healthy romance The sword 1
stirrup cup For even 1
simpler figure the adventures 1
be sane The dragon 1
without St George would 1
be grotesque So this 1
really human To Syme 1
the moon But even 1
the moon The tug 1
comparatively slowly The clear 1
to break It broke 1
of silver and these 1
Charing Cross The great 1
at them They were 1
white dawn They made 1
Egyptian palace and indeed 1
heathen kings He leapt 1
enormous masonry The two 1
up stream They had 1
a pyramid but before 1
the river As a 1
of fashion he had 1
his buttonhole As Syme 1
a hair and Syme 1
clean shaven This scrap 1
mere oversight the rest 1
way noble Syme drew 1
not stir At first 1
to meet Then seeing 1
was not And now 1
mad adventure For the 1
so close He was 1
same way Syme looked 1
the river Then he 1
beautiful face Then the 1
the left There was 1
about this Many people 1
even attractive But in 1
in it There was 1
classic face And there 1
went wrong The spasm 1
harmonious melancholy He spoke 1
for breakfast Sunday always 1
early breakfast Have you 1
after breakfast He spoke 1
his face It seemed 1
was hate After a 1
be told But the 1
tropical forest So in 1
just now Originally of 1
branch does Then Sunday 1
ordinary restaurant He said 1
you out Well he 1
I know but sometimes 1
old age For now 1
the public We have 1
people say asked Syme 1
him clever With this 1
Leicester Square It will 1
so continental It will 1
foreign look But on 1
and clear Between the 1
public place And this 1
new world As a 1
a boy But as 1
foreign town At one 1
street behind In the 1
coffee room and outside 1
dining table In fact 1
breakfast table and round 1
button holes Some of 1
the square Then the 1
European Dynamiters Then as 1
seen before He had 1
to see At the 1
a man When Syme 1
of stone His vastness 1
incredibly fat This man 1
as colossal His head 1
to be The ears 1
human ears He was 1
to scale and this 1
become dwarfish They were 1
to tea As Syme 1
they talk They do 1
ze king And the 1
gentlemen upstairs The two 1
in silence Syme had 1
in awe He knew 1
instantaneous certainty Syme indeed 1
mental health Utterly devoid 1
spiritual evil Twice already 1
of hell And this 1
great President The form 1
hateful fancy As he 1
and larger and Syme 1
scream aloud He remembered 1
so large By an 1
sat down The men 1
known him He sobered 1
coffee pot then he 1
at Sunday His face 1
to humanity In the 1
sufficiently commonplace nothing about 1
wedding breakfast One man 1
superficial glance He at 1
garden Dynamiter He wore 1
the occasion but out 1
Skye terrier But the 1
Russian serf The effect 1
utterly grotesque If out 1
idiotic contrast The man 1
was Gogol he was 1
called Tuesday His soul 1
incurably tragic he could 1
President Sunday And indeed 1
the idea He dresses 1
like one He insists 1
stage conspirator Now if 1
an anarchist But if 1
attract attention That s 1
Gogol does He goes 1
as anybody but you 1
an ass You try 1
inconsistent methods When a 1
the circumstance But if 1
forget it Now when 1
at anything While this 1
around him As he 1
queer return He had 1
hairy Gogol But as 1
detail somewhere That lop 1
these types Each man 1
hardly human The only 1
curved mirror Only the 1
concealed eccentricity Syme s 1
of Monday he was 1
happy laughter But now 1
other touches His fine 1
some disease yet somehow 1
denied this It was 1
troubled him His eyes 1
was pain He was 1
the tribe each man 1
differently wrong Next to 1
obviously mad Next was 1
de St Eustache a 1
characteristic figure The first 1
his own He had 1
even squarer But Syme 1
that suffocated It reminded 1
and Poe With this 1
softer materials his black 1
profound colour His black 1
a purple His black 1
a blue And in 1
and scornful Whatever he 1
a Frenchman he might 1
a Jew he might 1
the East In the 1
crimson lips Then came 1
it empty Save for 1
senile decay His face 1
mild despair In no 1
painful contrast For the 1
like lead the whole 1
a corpse When he 1
whole scene It did 1
but corruption Another hateful 1
quivering mind He could 1
fall off Right at 1
of all He was 1
of Bull He had 1
young doctors He carried 1
set smile There was 1
opaque spectacles It may 1
to Syme they reminded 1
the dead Syme s 1
blind grin Had the 1
been appropriate But on 1
an enigma They took 1
the face You could 1
gravity meant Partly from 1
wicked men Syme even 1
the world Again and 1
their presence Sometimes he 1
short sighted The sense 1
him again Each figure 1
of thought He knew 1
of reasoning He could 1
a spirit and that 1
was wicked So these 1
the verge The ends 1
closing in Talk had 1
the scene and not 1
terrible purport They were 1
immediate plot The waiter 1
and kings Only three 1
should die Even the 1
was chosen the black 1
the bomb Ordinarily speaking 1
mystical tremors He would 1
roaring gas But the 1
social responsibility Very simply 1
the Czar he had 1
for himself Most of 1
the sky But there 1
terrified him The President 1
baffling interest The enormous 1
his head And they 1
on Syme Syme felt 1
the balcony When the 1
of glass He had 1
a spy He looked 1
sunlit trees Then there 1
many days In the 1
of anarchism He even 1
when children But he 1
great promise He had 1
of doing He had 1
that policeman He took 1
stone balustrade His soul 1
moral indecision He had 1
beneath him He had 1
torture chamber Whenever he 1
common order Whenever he 1
unbearable eyes In all 1
his mind First it 1
stand alone The place 1
seem impossible But Sunday 1
iron trap Either by 1
strike him If he 1
innocent ailment If he 1
probably escape certainly not 1
busy square but he 1
empty sea There was 1
to him It never 1
the enemy Many moderns 1
great personality They might 1
super man If any 1
statue walking He might 1
be understood But this 1
extreme morbidity Like any 1
great force but he 1
admire it The men 1
Strasbourg pie But the 1
tepid water The old 1
second childhood And even 1
mere mass For he 1
twenty men he ate 1
sausage factory Yet continually 1
a knife Most of 1
a knife And it 1
personal tyrant Dynamite is 1
best symbol It is 1
the Christians It expands 1
it broadens even so 1
it broadens A man 1
and day It must 1
must expand A man 1
I die I thought 1
said Dr Bull with 1
worth doing The old 1
worth doing There was 1
the point The only 1
the blow I take 1
a bomb As to 1
all to The speech 1
vast shadow President Sunday 1
private room I have 1
to say Syme stood 1
the others The instant 1
his head On the 1
was cold A barrel 1
jovial tune Syme stood 1
the battle He found 1
from nowhere That jingling 1
of Christendom His youthful 1
his mind he did 1
dark room But he 1
barrel organ And this 1
around him For an 1
the commonplace He felt 1
powerful errors He knew 1
President Sunday but in 1
a rhinoceros All was 1
was right There clanged 1
ont droit which in 1
great iron This liberation 1
embrace death If the 1
could he This very 1
to miscreants It was 1
even understand The barrel 1
whole orchestra and he 1
of death The conspirators 1
rooms behind Syme went 1
romantic rhythm The President 1
abandoned boardroom When they 1
the door The first 1
nod ide You zay 1
show himselves It is 1
all nuzzinks Ven you 1
dark box The President 1
go afterwards If we 1
the keyhole You don 1
zare oppressors I care 1
of gonzealment I would 1
their oppressors So that 1
all right And now 1

incomprehensible scorn Four of 1
his meaning Syme alone 1
the bone If the 1
passed unsuspected They meant 1
the others The other 1
past midday The Professor 1
and painfully Syme sat 1
strange position He had 1
a cloud At last 1
Leicester Square The bright 1
of snow While he 1
the balcony Hoping therefore 1
evening dress Snow however 1
fall fast and Syme 1
empty street He was 1
a man His top 1
and ankles but it 1
evening dress That any 1
to Syme but his 1
personal shock for he 1
de Worms It scarcely 1
and infirmities Syme was 1
dehumanized brotherhood but even 1
wax lady He could 1
or trance He was 1
compassionate concern On the 1
miles behind For Syme 1
an hour Then he 1
with Gregory He strolled 1
for lunch He partook 1
still thinking He had 1
of foreigners He remembered 1
were anarchists He shuddered 1
real thing But even 1
of escape The wine 1
bad dream and although 1
distant one Tall houses 1
shameful seven he was 1
the free With a 1
shop below When he 1
the spot At a 1
pendent eyelids For an 1
leant upon Then with 1
following me he asked 1
me up One comfort 1
as Timbuctoo Or am 1
too fanciful Was he 1
following me Surely Sunday 1
lame man He set 1
Covent Garden As he 1
to darken The snow 1
silver bees Getting into 1
irritated nerves and by 1
take shelter He ordered 1
an excuse Scarcely had 1
of milk Syme s 1
concealed steel But the 1
look round Syme who 1
conjuring trick He had 1
cab following he had 1
the shop to all 1
on foot But the 1
the wind He started 1
coffee untasted An omnibus 1
unusual rapidity He had 1
reach it but he 1
the top When he 1
asthmatic breathing Turning sharply 1
de Worms He let 1
mackintosh rug Every movement 1
the body He moved 1
of caution And yet 1
the omnibus Syme sprang 1
the steps He had 1
the side Too bewildered 1
a hole He had 1
the scent He dived 1
than thoroughfares and by 1
of pursuit There was 1
soundless snow Somewhere behind 1
cobble stones He thought 1
the maze But when 1
infernal cripple The sky 1
the evening On each 1
and featureless there was 1
of eve He felt 1
lit street Yet he 1
main thoroughfare When he 1
had fancied He came 1
saw St Paul s 1
the sky At first 1
the city Then he 1
was natural first because 1
was Sunday And at 1
his lip the word 1
indecent pun Under the 1
the sea The sealed 1
of St Paul s 1
the snow But right 1
the cathedral and upon 1
Alpine peak It had 1
the cross When Syme 1
involuntary salute He knew 1
not care It seemed 1
was bright The devils 1
the cross He had 1
pursuing paralytic and at 1
his pursuer Professor de 1
crooked mile He really 1
been threading He came 1
patient face Syme waited 1
as St George waited 1
for death And the 1
mournful eyelids There was 1
final fury The man 1
an accident Syme was 1
boyish derision He made 1
open Circus Concealment was 1
impossible now and looking 1
mile race But the 1
a harlequin This outrageous 1
round St Paul s 1
ever known Then Syme 1
the docks He saw 1
ordered beer It was 1
knives drawn A moment 1
fully returned This incomprehensible 1
pursued him If the 1
more soothing It would 1
him out He emptied 1
his milk One possibility 1
yet helpless It was 1
of him Perhaps it 1
or sign Perhaps the 1
have understood Perhaps it 1
a ritual Perhaps the 1
along it He was 1
him short Before Syme 1
a policeman Whatever else 1
as this Even his 1
A policeman he said 1
a policeman I think 1
the restaurant asked Syme 1
me somewhere Have my 1
watchful look Why must 1

his feet Then came 1
opposite conviction For the 1

free man For with 1
healthy humiliation There comes 1
third laughter Syme s 1

the gloom The small 1
fallen world Syme felt 1
and shadows but his 1

whether Dr Bull has 1
to bed He is 1
to bed Turning the 1
other bank On the 1
insane height Their special 1
hundred eyes Syme had 1
a dream Even as 1
innumerable eyes Professor de 1

very thoroughly The beans 1

twice two But two 1
twice one two is 1
times one That is 1
to monogamy Syme was 1
the river He did 1
old friends On his 1
an idealist He made 1
an anarchist But I 1
a realist I am 1
portrait painter But indeed 1
inadequate expression I am 1

partially paralytic When I 1
imitate him If I 1
a caricature I was 1

of admiration The curse 1
upon me I had 1
too true They thought 1
Nihilist Professor I was 1
a blow Before I 1
next room I inquired 1
its nature It seemed 1
of myself I had 1
situation through Consequently it 1
a collision The pessimists 1
more feeble But I 1
of life You see 1
I was Then he 1
claims intellectually I countered 1
simple dodge Whenever he 1
of differentiation I replied 1
in Pinckwerts the notion 1
by Glumpe It is 1
and Glumpe But the 1
in Montaigne Need I 1
your beard I had 1
rather witty But I 1
of victory The real 1
his nose He is 1
delightful impostor His apparent 1
human being To my 1
enormous policeman He told 1

the world You are 1
de Worms The policeman 1
exactly sir I am 1
de Worms This charge 1
greatly dismayed I was 1
public safety He offered 1
blue card Though our 1
and humour but I 1
personally because Syme laid 1
dark room Professor de 1
curious one Inside I 1
boyish merriment but I 1
leave off So that 1
my forehead I can 1
of way The most 1
quite different You should 1
old cock It would 1
bit worried The Professor 1
with you Yes I 1
my head There is 1
two hands Then he 1
good touch Then as 1
is lifted After a 1
see tomorrow You and 1
the Tower We are 1
wicked man I believe 1
in goggles He has 1
the Secretary But then 1
redeeming trait But the 1
s disease Don t 1
and vitality He bounces 1
rubber ball Depend on 1
independent fingers Syme if 1
not see I have 1
frequently require Syme poured 1
the scheme He was 1
or knee But wine 1
to Dr Bull about 1
appearing forced We might 1
say Dr Bull as 1
a tragedy What the 1
you do I wish 1
wider scope I suppose 1
the toes That would 1
to bed Syme however 1
new code He was 1
his bed Syme sat 1
bed blinking then slowly 1
stood up It seemed 1
cold danger He still 1
his companion but it 1
of yours Did it 1
it up The Professor 1
wintry sea so Syme 1
all this I m 1
s grind Did you 1
the spot The Professor 1
was silent his eyes 1
take you The Professor 1
you answer called out 1
fear underneath Whether or 1
did not Syme stood 1
blue eyes His first 1
more frightful After all 1
a friend What did 1
ridiculous tale How improbable 1
beside Gogol Was this 1
declaring war Was this 1
last time He stood 1
heartless silence He almost 1
corridor outside Then his 1
out laughing Though the 1
dead table Syme watched 1
like this We must 1
to it He rapped 1
All right Let s 1
to breakfast They took 1
in silence but as 1
it hard They paused 1
as Acheron They reached 1
the banisters At about 1
a window each window 1
over London From each 1
after rain Syme was 1
the past Last night 1
a dream As he 1
infinite series But it 1
or delusion Their infinity 1
to thought Or it 1
fixed stars He was 1
unreason itself By the 1
reached Dr Bull s 1
red cloud And when 1
entered Dr Bull s 1
of light Syme had 1
austere daybreak The moment 1
and Dr Bull sitting 1
French Revolution There should 1
breeches only his cropped 1
its wig he might 1
slipshod Robespierre Yet when 1
fell away The Jacobins 1
were idealists there was 1
murderous materialism His Dosition 1
new appearance The strong 1
the balcony Thus the 1
s head And indeed 1
been he He looked 1
had spoken He set 1
dark tweed he buttoned 1
his table The quiet 1
opponents helpless It was 1
Paris affair Then he 1
without speaking The Professor 1
excessively abrupt but I 1
for him Comrade Syme 1
on it I will 1
to discuss He was 1
his hand But the 1
uphill work Syme began 1
and despair The Doctor 1
hour before About the 1
a gollywog Syme remembered 1
in childhood But here 1
was daylight here was 1
a word The whole 1
unbearable reality Under the 1
realistic novel But his 1
head polite the only 1
have narrated but as 1
than me His words 1
an anthem but Syme 1
crazy table He read 1
go on This devil 1
me dry Syme plunged 1
respectable person Wishing to 1
the Savoy Under this 1
in France So unless 1
his track The Doctor 1
still impenetrable The Professor 1
of it It seems 1
urgent that All this 1
the smile The nerves 1
the table His message 1
an intuition The Professor 1
on it Syme telegraphed 1
quite extraordinary The other 1
Extraordinary rot Syme said 1
a poet The other 1
dead man Syme had 1
burning feverishly As he 1
lightheaded certainty Resuming his 1
intuition is It has 1
of spring He then 1
s fingers The answer 1
to hell The Professor 1
lush woods His companion 1
beautiful woman The Professor 1
to act He leant 1
small favour Would you 1
your spectacles The Professor 1
of astonishment Syme like 1
fiery face The Doctor 1
not move For a 1
the Thames Then Dr 1
his spectacles Syme sprang 1
successful explosion His eyes 1
without speaking The Professor 1
supposed paralysis He leant 1
at Dr Bull as 1
his eyes And indeed 1
transformation scene The two 1
rather commonplace The smile 1
the Pope It was 1
did it It was 1
the spectacles Given those 1
be damned roared Syme 1
at him Look at 1
blessed boots You don 1
police officer There s 1
the table The Professor 1
was lost but he 1
France together Yes I 1
of form Clapping a 1
followed him Syme seemed 1
against three The Professor 1
so lucky We were 1
against One The others 1
in silence The young 1
the street but there 1
quite alone I nearly 1
been imprudent I hope 1
blue funk But the 1
infernal goggles The young 1
a rag he said 1
my own I haven 1
the brains You see 1
dynamite business But for 1
a dynamiter and they 1
a dynamiter They said 1
British Constitution They said 1
and benevolent they called 1
Scotland Yard They said 1
honest man but as 1
a criminal But as 1
his shoulders And there 1
talked hopelessly One asked 1
nice smile another said 1
negro anarchist but this 1
him now he looks 1
office boy Put him 1
of him And so 1
by George When once 1
little devil As I 1
like miracles but that 1
of it There was 1
was that asked Syme 1
at all Syme s 1
was that he asked 1
a coalcellar There you 1

first time He reflected 1
myself first I promised 1
the police I m 1

said Dr Bull and 1
my mind I gave 1
upside down My friends 1
ever human It may 1
in hell Well I 1
him down It s 1
a leper I may 1
I feel and there 1
sunlit sea Then he 1
quite right and we 1

at Bannockburn Since 1350 1
the field The motto 1
of St Eustache also 1
very ancient The Marquis 1
a gentleman He cannot 1
a gentleman And in 1
hat off But here 1
the harbour They went 1
of daze Syme who 1
the sea As he 1
a sword He was 1
stopped abruptly With a 1
de St Eustache his 1
pleased impatience He was 1
curious hilarity His spirits 1
unnaturally high they rose 1
of nonsense He professed 1
deadly Marquis He jotted 1
a pencil It was 1

my own I shall 1
I believe He will 1
I presume He will 1

for him In that 1
more forced Syme struck 1
of it Sir you 1
the common You will 1
an owl said the 1
to kill And since 1
by himself And so 1
by George And he 1
sea breeze A band 1
stopped singing On Syme 1
to die He looked 1
Marquis sat The man 1
social position Besides these 1
even barbaric but he 1
the Marquis Indeed one 1
purple sea But he 1
any rate he was 1
groaning slaves Just so 1
the meeting asked the 1
without moving Syme drained 1
that meeting That meeting 1
displeases me I am 1
coloured nose He stepped 1
quite steadily The Marquis 1
he said Syme bowed 1
your nose He leant 1
insulted me said Syme 1
Insulted you cried the 1
your mother exclaimed the 1
just now said the 1
he said said Syme 1
the band I only 1
Wagner badly It was 1
painful subject We are 1

By George said Syme 1
with me he cried 1
with me By God 1

for me There are 1
of daylight Let us 1
this evening Syme bowed 1
and blood Permit me 1
place myself In three 1
of him For now 1
the beast But look 1
listen carefully There is 1
for talk You are 1
for Paris If he 1
his crime He can 1
and place But this 1
will do He will 1
the train He is 1
catch it But I 1
is lost Then perhaps 1
his feelings You understand 1
previously heard Syme was 1
his character They were 1
of prophecy He had 1
his opponent When the 1
the capital Naturally he 1
had predicted He induced 1
first engagement When he 1
a journey his hands 1
the sun But it 1
luncheon basket Early as 1
knee deep With the 1
chimney pots the little 1
a farce Syme could 1
flowers everywhere But indeed 1
black business On his 1
little wood far away 1
it was In front 1
the sea The member 1
and Dr Bull with 1
was disabled Syme had 1
twenty minutes In twenty 1
de St Eustache said 1
his stick Syme understood 1
in sight But there 1
the horizon Colonel Ducroix 1
white fire He offered 1
with dignity Then the 1
to Dr Bull proceeded 1
the men Both combatants 1
in hand The seconds 1
and hats The principals 1
quietly Engage and the 1
and tingled When the 1
in bed He remembered 1
of science The first 1
ever happen But he 1
common sense He felt 1
be hanged For as 1
had come He felt 1
his feet he felt 1
living things He could 1
grass growing he could 1
the spring And whenever 1
sky line He had 1
the world But while 1
himself capable Once his 1
tacitly ignored Every now 1
was mistaken Then came 1
a change At the 1
his right Then he 1
twenty weapons The attack 1
shining arrows Syme had 1
the railway but also 1
no need He could 1
in sight But the 1
reached itself Twice Syme 1
fighting circle and the 1
this time Syme s 1
had pierced Syme was 1
the ground Yet the 1
an idiot There was 1
at all There was 1
flaming curiosity The Marquis 1
a disadvantage He fought 1
pointed steel Syme on 1
bloodless sword For this 1
and head A minute 1
the jaw It came 1
out clean Half mad 1
s cheek But there 1
no scar For one 1
supernatural terrors Surely the 1
charmed life But this 1
pursued him The Professor 1
a goblin this man 1
the Devil Anyhow this 1
no mark When Syme 1
the trees He thought 1
standing by Perhaps he 1
a devil I am 1
a man I can 1
Paris train He fell 1
for Paradise As the 1
in Paris he joined 1
against Hell His thoughts 1
piercing whistle The train 1
his sword The leap 1
the matter asked Colonel 1
said Dr Bull who 1
my nose Would you 1
as possible I have 1
said Dr Bull indignantly 1
the combatants But one 1
my nose said the 1
Mr Syme You wanted 1
do it You can 1
to me Don t 1
so selfish Pull my 1
ask you and he 1
fascinating smile The Paris 1
neighbouring hill Syme had 1
toppling over Walking in 1
remarkable nobleman He pulled 1
his hand He stood 1
imbecile scene The Marquis 1

left eyebrow It s 1
I know said the 1
a mistake but it 1
just now I tell 1
said Dr Bull fiercely 1
the station It shall 1
without you We know 1
s work The mysterious 1
desperate gesture He was 1
me mad he cried 1
his sword The wild 1
damned fool he said 1
a Jabberwock cried the 1
I am Did you 1
that train Twenty Paris 1
for me Damn Paris 1
care about began the 1
care about I didn 1
the train I cared 1
by God it has 1
my mind Perhaps if 1
become clearer Mental lucidity 1
many ways What do 1
caught you It may 1
of everything Sunday has 1
of course said the 1
his face The head 1
to them But if 1
his pocket The Professor 1
paper chase The little 1
good taste Here he 1
the situation In the 1
serious apology but I 1
of honour You have 1
your time you have 1
the world We are 1
vast conspiracy A secret 1
like hares not such 1
like vermin How hard 1
you suffer The younger 1
the apology but you 1
good morning The sight 1
one day Colonel Ducroix 1
the town Colonel Ducroix 1
through it I have 1
With whom asked Syme 1
by God if this 1
against anarchy Every born 1
personal secretary What can 1
struck dead Don t 1
know Sunday Don t 1
of them Can you 1
not supreme I tell 1
railway line and he 1
by him half the 1
each other Idiots that 1
our idiocies Sunday knew 1
in France And he 1
extreme solitude He has 1
the world it only 1
in it And since 1
tell you My objection 1
of it Syme uttered 1
off station It was 1
their direction But they 1
de St Eustache said 1
opera glasses Either the 1
that mob They have 1
decorative spectacles He handed 1
the face Syme almost 1
through them Most men 1
ordinary enough but it 1
their mouths This disguise 1
the front But presently 1
those people answered Syme 1
by God I believe 1
would shake After an 1
with them I wish 1
he were Much more 1
of St Paul s 1
is absurd said Syme 1
our absence but he 1
like that It is 1
this way but they 1
valuable force But let 1
s universe He has 1
telegraphs himself But to 1
post card it may 1
the grass Then he 1
for death but if 1
after me With these 1
the wood The others 1
the plain They saw 1
they wore They turned 1
twinkling trees The sun 1
and hot So in 1
dim pool The inside 1
shaken shadows They made 1
a cinematograph Even the 1
upon them Now a 1
else obliterated now again 1
a negro The ex 1
their pursuers The fancy 1
of wonder Was he 1
a mask Was anyone 1
a mask Was anyone 1
other people That tragic 1
a friend He felt 1
an enemy Was there 1
it seemed The Marquis 1
a detective Might he 1
a hobgoblin Was not 1
and light Everything only 1
always forgotten For Gabriel 1
found there He had 1
the universe As a 1
his fancies With two 1
as Ratcliffe In a 1
going to So genuine 1
all this cried Syme 1
that way Surely not 1
Mere mobs repeated his 1
the question You ve 1
the poor Why should 1
been anarchists they have 1
decent government The poor 1
the country The rich 1
hasn t he can 1
a yacht The poor 1
governed badly the rich 1
at all Aristocrats were 1
very nice but I 1
American millionaires That is 1
the communications and that 1
all mad But getting 1
one thing getting hold 1
is another I would 1
of him They had 1
good sense and in 1
awful actuality Burnt by 1
a hatchet His cart 1
of timber and the 1
not desperate like his 1
almost sad The man 1
very angular and his 1
to defend But I 1
said Dr Bull doubtfully 1
out Dr Bull suddenly 1

exultant music Every couple 1
separate romance it might 1

The Man Who Was 0
Thursday by G K 0
Chesterton 1908 To Edmund 0
A cloud was on 0
the mind of men 0
and wailing went the 0
weather Yea a sick 0
cloud upon the soul 0
when we were boys 0
Science announced nonentity and 0
The world was old 0
and ended but you 0
and I were gay 0
Round us in antic 0
order their crippled vices 0
came Lust that had 0
lost its laughter fear 0
that had lost its 0
Like the white lock 0
of Whistler that lit 0
our aimless gloom Men 0
showed their own white 0
feather as proudly as 0
Life was a fly 0
that faded and death 0
a drone that stung 0
The world was very 0
old indeed when you 0
and I were young 0
They twisted even decent 0
sin to shapes not 0
to be named Men 0
were ashamed of honour 0
but we were not 0
Weak if we were 0
and foolish not thus 0
we failed not thus 0
When that black Baal 0
blocked the heavens he 0
had no hymns from 0
us Children we were 0
our forts of sand 0
were even as weak 0
as eve High as 0
they went we piled 0
them up to break 0
Fools as we were 0
in motley all jangling 0
and absurd When all 0
church bells were silent 0
our cap and beds 0
Not all unhelped we 0
held the fort our 0
Some giants laboured in 0
that cloud to lift 0
it from the world 0
I find again the 0
book we found I 0
feel the hour that 0
flings Far out of 0
fish shaped Paumanok some 0
cry of cleaner things 0
And the Green Carnation 0
withered as in forest 0
fires that pass Roared 0
in the wind of 0
all the world ten 0
million leaves of grass 0
Or sane and sweet 0
and sudden as a 0
bird sings in the 0
rain Truth out of 0
Tusitala spoke and pleasure 0
Yea cool and clear 0
and sudden as a 0
bird sings in the 0
grey Dunedin to Samoa 0
spoke and darkness unto 0
But we were young 0
we lived to see 0
God break their bitter 0
God and the good 0
Republic come riding back 0
in arms We have 0
seen the City of 0
Mansoul even as it 0
rocked relieved Blessed are 0
they who did not 0
see but being blind 0
This is a tale 0
of those old fears 0
even of those emptied 0
hells And none but 0
you shall understand the 0
true thing that it 0
tells Of what colossal 0
gods of shame could 0
cow men and yet 0
crash Of what huge 0
devils hid the stars 0
yet fell at a 0
The doubts that were 0
so plain to chase 0
so dreadful to withstand 0
Oh who shall understand 0
yea who shall understand 0
The doubts that drove 0
us through the night 0
as we two talked 0
amain And day had 0
broken on the streets 0
e er it broke 0
Between us by the 0
peace of God such 0
truth can now be 0
Yea there is strength 0
in striking root and 0
good in growing old 0
We have found common 0
things at last and 0
marriage and a creed 0
And I may safely 0
write it now and 0
you may safely read 0
G K C CHAPTER 0
I THE TWO POETS 0
THE suburb of Saffron 0
Park lay on the 0
sunset side of London 0
as red and ragged 0
as a cloud of 0
It was built of 0
a bright brick throughout 0
its sky line was 0
fantastic and even its 0
ground plan was wild 0
It had been the 0
outburst of a speculative 0
builder faintly tinged with 0
art who called its 0
architecture sometimes Elizabethan and 0
sometimes Queen Anne apparently 0
under the impression that 0
the two sovereigns were 0
It was described with 0
some justice as an 0
artistic colony though it 0
never in any definable 0
way produced any art 0
But although its pretensions 0
to be an intellectual 0
centre were a little 0
vague its pretensions to 0
be a pleasant place 0
The stranger who looked 0
for the first time 0
at the quaint red 0
houses could only think 0
how very oddly shaped 0
the people must be 0
who could fit in 0
Nor when he met 0
the people was he 0
disappointed in this respect 0
The place was not 0
only pleasant but perfect 0
if once he could 0
regard it not as 0
a deception but rather 0
Even if the people 0
were not artists the 0
whole was nevertheless artistic 0
That young man with 0
the long auburn hair 0
and the impudent face 0
that young man was 0
not really a poet 0
but surely he was 0
That old gentleman with 0
the wild white beard 0
and the wild white 0
hat that venerable humbug 0
was not really a 0
but at least he 0
was the cause of 0
That scientific gentleman with 0
the bald egg like 0
head and the bare 0
bird like neck had 0
no real right to 0
the airs of science 0
He had not discovered 0
anything new in biology 0
but what biological creature 0
could he have discovered 0
more singular than himself 0
Thus and thus only 0
the whole place had 0
properly to be regarded 0
it had to be 0
considered not so much 0
as a workshop for 0
artists but as a 0
frail but finished work 0
A man who stepped 0
into its social atmosphere 0
felt as if he 0
had stepped into a 0
More especially this attractive 0
unreality fell upon it 0
about nightfall when the 0
extravagant roofs were dark 0
against the afterglow and 0
the whole insane village 0
seemed as separate as 0
This again was more 0
strongly true of the 0
many nights of local 0
festivity when the little 0
gardens were often illuminated 0
and the big Chinese 0
lanterns glowed in the 0
dwarfish trees like some 0
fierce and monstrous fruit 0
And this was strongest 0
of all on one 0
particular evening still vaguely 0
remembered in the locality 0
of which the auburn 0
haired poet was the 0
It was not by 0
any means the only 0
evening of which he 0
On many nights those 0
passing by his little 0
back garden might hear 0
his high didactic voice 0
laying down the law 0
to men and particularly 0
The attitude of women 0
in such cases was 0
indeed one of the 0
paradoxes of the place 0
Most of the women 0
were of the kind 0
vaguely called emancipated and 0
professed some protest against 0
Yet these new women 0
would always pay to 0
a man the extravagant 0
compliment which no ordinary 0
woman ever pays to 0
him that of listening 0
while he is talking 0
And Mr Lucian Gregory 0
the red haired poet 0
a man worth listening 0
to even if one 0
only laughed at the 0
He put the old 0
cant of the lawlessness 0
of art and the 0
art of lawlessness with 0
a certain impudent freshness 0
which gave at least 0
He was helped in 0
some degree by the 0
arresting oddity of his 0
appearance which he worked 0
as the phrase goes 0
for all it was 0
His dark red hair 0
parted in the middle 0
was literally like a 0
woman s and curved 0
into the slow curls 0
of a virgin in 0
a pre Raphaelite picture 0
From within this almost 0
saintly oval however his 0
face projected suddenly broad 0
and brutal the chin 0
carried forward with a 0
look of cockney contempt 0
This combination at once 0
tickled and terrified the 0
nerves of a neurotic 0
He seemed like a 0
walking blasphemy a blend 0
of the angel and 0
This particular evening if 0
it is remembered for 0
nothing else will be 0
remembered in that place 0
for its strange sunset 0
It looked like the 0
end of the world 0
All the heaven seemed 0
covered with a quite 0
vivid and palpable plumage 0
you could only say 0
that the sky was 0
full of feathers and 0
of feathers that almost 0
Across the great part 0
of the dome they 0
were grey with the 0
strangest tints of violet 0
and mauve and an 0
unnatural pink or pale 0
but towards the west 0
the whole grew past 0
description transparent and passionate 0
and the last red 0
hot plumes of it 0
covered up the sun 0
like something too good 0
The whole was so 0
close about the earth 0
as to express nothing 0
but a violent secrecy 0
The very empyrean seemed 0
to be a secret 0
It expressed that splendid 0
smallness which is the 0
soul of local patriotism 0
The very sky seemed 0
I say that there 0
are some inhabitants who 0
may remember the evening 0
if only by that 0
There are others who 0
may remember it because 0
it marked the first 0
appearance in the place 0
of the second poet 0
For a long time 0
the red haired revolutionary 0
had reigned without a 0
it was upon the 0
night of the sunset 0
that his solitude suddenly 0
The new poet who 0
introduced himself by the 0
name of Gabriel Syme 0
was a very mild 0
looking mortal with a 0
fair pointed beard and 0
But an impression grew 0
that he was less 0
meek than he looked 0
He signalised his entrance 0
by differing with the 0
established poet Gregory upon 0
the whole nature of 0
He said that he 0
was poet of law 0
a poet of order 0
nay he said he 0
was a poet of 0
So all the Saffron 0
Parkers looked at him 0
as if he had 0
that moment fallen out 0
of that impossible sky 0
In fact Mr Lucian 0
Gregory the anarchic poet 0
connected the two events 0
It may well be 0
he said in his 0
sudden lyrical manner it 0
may well be on 0
such a night of 0
clouds and cruel colours 0
that there is brought 0
forth upon the earth 0
such a portent as 0
You say you are 0
a poet of law 0
I say you are 0
a contradiction in terms 0
I only wonder there 0
were not comets and 0
earthquakes on the night 0
you appeared in this 0
The man with the 0
meek blue eyes and 0
the pale pointed beard 0
endured these thunders with 0
a certain submissive solemnity 0
The third party of 0
the group Gregory s 0
sister Rosamond who had 0
her brother s braids 0
of red hair but 0
a kindlier face underneath 0
them laughed with such 0
mixture of admiration and 0
disapproval as she gave 0
commonly to the family 0
Gregory resumed in high 0
An artist is identical 0
with an anarchist he 0
You might transpose the 0
An anarchist is an 0
The man who throws 0
a bomb is an 0
artist because he prefers 0
a great moment to 0
He sees how much 0
more valuable is one 0
burst of blazing light 0
one peal of perfect 0
thunder than the mere 0
common bodies of a 0
An artist disregards all 0
governments abolishes all conventions 0
The poet delights in 0
If it were not 0
so the most poetical 0
thing in the world 0
would be the Underground 0
So it is said 0
said Gregory who was 0
very rational when anyone 0
Why do all the 0
clerks and navvies in 0
the railway trains look 0
so sad and tired 0
so very sad and 0
I will tell you 0
It is because they 0
know that the train 0
It is because they 0
know that whatever place 0
they have taken a 0
ticket for that place 0
It is because after 0
they have passed Sloane 0
Square they know that 0
the next station must 0
be Victoria and nothing 0
Oh their wild rapture 0
oh their eyes like 0
stars and their souls 0
again in Eden if 0
the next station were 0
It is you who 0
are unpoetical replied the 0
If what you say 0
of clerks is true 0
they can only be 0
as prosaic as your 0
The rare strange thing 0
is to hit the 0
the gross obvious thing 0
is to miss it 0
We feel it is 0
epical when man with 0
one wild arrow strikes 0
Is it not also 0
epical when man with 0
one wild engine strikes 0
because in chaos the 0
train might indeed go 0
anywhere to Baker Street 0
But man is a 0
magician and his whole 0
magic is in this 0
that he does say 0
No take your books 0
of mere poetry and 0
let me read a 0
time table with tears 0
Take your Byron who 0
commemorates the defeats of 0
give me Bradshaw who 0
Give me Bradshaw I 0
I tell you went 0
on Syme with passion 0
that every time a 0
train comes in I 0
feel that it has 0
broken past batteries of 0
besiegers and that man 0
has won a battle 0
You say contemptuously that 0
when one has left 0
Sloane Square one must 0
I say that one 0
might do a thousand 0
things instead and that 0
whenever I really come 0
there I have the 0
sense of hairbreadth escape 0
And when I hear 0
the guard shout out 0
the word Victoria it 0
is not an unmeaning 0
It is to me 0
the cry of a 0
It is to me 0
it is the victory 0
Gregory wagged his heavy 0
red head with a 0
slow and sad smile 0
And even then he 0
said we poets always 0
ask the question And 0
what is Victoria now 0
that you have got 0
You think Victoria is 0
like the New Jerusalem 0
We know that the 0
New Jerusalem will only 0
Yes the poet will 0
be discontented even in 0
the streets of heaven 0
The poet is always 0
There again said Syme 0
irritably what is there 0
poetical about being in 0
You might as well 0
say that it is 0
poetical to be sea 0
Being sick is a 0
Both being sick and 0
being rebellious may be 0
the wholesome thing on 0
but I m hanged 0
if I can see 0
why they are poetical 0
Revolt in the abstract 0
It s mere vomiting 0
The girl winced for 0
a flash at the 0
unpleasant word but Syme 0
was too hot to 0
It is things going 0
right he cried that 0
is poetical I Our 0
digestions for instance going 0
sacredly and silently right 0
that is the foundation 0
Yes the most poetical 0
thing more poetical than 0
the flowers more poetical 0
than the stars the 0
most poetical thing in 0
the world is not 0
Really said Gregory superciliously 0
the examples you choose 0
I beg your pardon 0
said Syme grimly I 0
forgot we had abolished 0
For the first time 0
a red patch appeared 0
on Gregory s forehead 0
You don t expect 0
me he said to 0
revolutionise society on this 0
Syme looked straight into 0
his eyes and smiled 0
No I don t 0
but I suppose that 0
if you were serious 0
about your anarchism that 0
is exactly what you 0
Gregory s big bull 0
s eyes blinked suddenly 0
like those of an 0
angry lion and one 0
could almost fancy that 0
his red mane rose 0
Don t you think 0
then he said in 0
a dangerous voice that 0
I am serious about 0
I beg your pardon 0
Am I not serious 0
cried Gregory with knotted 0
said Syme and strolled 0
With surprise but with 0
a curious pleasure he 0
found Rosamond Gregory still 0
Mr Syme she said 0
do the people who 0
talk like you and 0
my brother often mean 0
Do you mean what 0
What do you mean 0
asked the girl with 0
My dear Miss Gregory 0
said Syme gently there 0
are many kinds of 0
When you say thank 0
you for the salt 0
do you mean what 0
When you say the 0
world is round do 0
you mean what you 0
It is true but 0
you don t mean 0
Now sometimes a man 0
like your brother really 0
finds a thing he 0
It may be only 0
a half truth quarter 0
but then he says 0
more than he means 0
from sheer force of 0
She was looking at 0
him from under level 0
her face was grave 0
and open and there 0
had fallen upon it 0
the shadow of that 0
unreasoning responsibility which is 0
at the bottom of 0
the most frivolous woman 0
the maternal watch which 0
is as old as 0
Is he really an 0
Only in that sense 0
I speak of replied 0
or if you prefer 0
it in that nonsense 0
She drew her broad 0
brows together and said 0
He wouldn t really 0
use bombs or that 0
Syme broke into a 0
great laugh that seemed 0
too large for his 0
slight and somewhat dandified 0
he said that has 0
to be done anonymously 0
And at that the 0
corners of her own 0
mouth broke into a 0
smile and she thought 0
with a simultaneous pleasure 0
of Gregory s absurdity 0
and of his safety 0
Syme strolled with her 0
to a seat in 0
the corner of the 0
garden and continued to 0
pour out his opinions 0
For he was a 0
sincere man and in 0
spite of his superficial 0
airs and graces at 0
root a humble one 0
And it is always 0
the humble man who 0
the proud man watches 0
He defended respectability with 0
He grew passionate in 0
his praise of tidiness 0
All the time there 0
was a smell of 0
lilac all round him 0
Once he heard very 0
faintly in some distant 0
street a barrel organ 0
begin to play and 0
it seemed to him 0
that his heroic words 0
were moving to a 0
tiny tune from under 0
or beyond the world 0
He stared and talked 0
at the girl s 0
red hair and amused 0
face for what seemed 0
to be a few 0
and then feeling that 0
the groups in such 0
a place should mix 0
rose to his feet 0
To his astonishment he 0
discovered the whole garden 0
Everyone had gone long 0
ago and he went 0
himself with a rather 0
He left with a 0
sense of champagne in 0
his head which he 0
could not afterwards explain 0
In the wild events 0
which were to follow 0
this girl had no 0
he never saw her 0
again until all his 0
And yet in some 0
indescribable way she kept 0
recurring like a motive 0
in music through all 0
his mad adventures afterwards 0
and the glory of 0
her strange hair ran 0
like a red thread 0
through those dark and 0
ill drawn tapestries of 0
For what followed was 0
so improbable that it 0
might well have been 0
When Syme went out 0
into the starlit street 0
he found it for 0
in some odd way 0
that the silence was 0
rather a living silence 0
than a dead one 0
Directly outside the door 0
stood a street lamp 0
whose gleam gilded the 0
leaves of the tree 0
that bent out over 0
the fence behind him 0
About a foot from 0
the lamp post stood 0
a figure almost as 0
rigid and motionless as 0
the lamp post itself 0
The tall hat and 0
long frock coat were 0
the face in an 0
abrupt shadow was almost 0
Only a fringe of 0
fiery hair against the 0
light and also something 0
aggressive in the attitude 0
proclaimed that it was 0
He had something of 0
the look of a 0
masked bravo waiting sword 0
in hand for his 0
He made a sort 0
of doubtful salute which 0
Syme somewhat more formally 0
I was waiting for 0
Might I have a 0
asked Syme in a 0
sort of weak wonder 0
Gregory struck out with 0
his stick at the 0
lamp post and then 0
About this and this 0
about order and anarchy 0
There is your precious 0
order that lean iron 0
lamp ugly and barren 0
and there is anarchy 0
rich living reproducing itself 0
there is anarchy splendid 0
in green and gold 0
All the same replied 0
Syme patiently just at 0
present you only see 0
the tree by the 0
light of the lamp 0
I wonder when you 0
would ever see the 0
lamp by the light 0
Then after a pause 0
he said But may 0
I ask if you 0
have been standing out 0
here in the dark 0
only to resume our 0
No cried out Gregory 0
in a voice that 0
rang down the street 0
I did not stand 0
here to resume our 0
argument but to end 0
The silence fell again 0
and Syme though he 0
understood nothing listened instinctively 0
Gregory began in a 0
smooth voice and with 0
a rather bewildering smile 0
Mr Syme he said 0
this evening you succeeded 0
in doing something rather 0
You did something to 0
me that no man 0
born of woman has 0
ever succeeded in doing 0
Now I remember resumed 0
Gregory reflectively one other 0
person succeeded in doing 0
The captain of a 0
if I remember correctly 0
You have irritated me 0
I am very sorry 0
replied Syme with gravity 0
I am afraid my 0
fury and your insult 0
are too shocking to 0
be wiped out even 0
with an apology said 0
No duel could wipe 0
If I struck you 0
dead I could not 0
There is only one 0
way by which that 0
insult can be erased 0
and that way I 0
I am going at 0
the possible sacrifice of 0
my life and honour 0
to prove to you 0
that you were wrong 0
in what you said 0
In what I said 0
You said I was 0
not serious about being 0
There are degrees of 0
I have never doubted 0
that you were perfectly 0
sincere in this sense 0
that you thought what 0
you said well worth 0
saying that you thought 0
a paradox might wake 0
men up to a 0
Gregory stared at him 0
And in no other 0
sense he asked you 0
You think me a 0
flaneur who lets fall 0
You do not think 0
that in a deeper 0
a more deadly sense 0
Syme struck his stick 0
violently on the stones 0
is this street serious 0
Are these damned Chinese 0
Is the whole caboodle 0
One comes here and 0
talks a pack of 0
bosh and perhaps some 0
sense as well but 0
I should think very 0
little of a man 0
who didn t keep 0
something in the background 0
of his life that 0
was more serious than 0
all this talking something 0
more serious whether it 0
was religion or only 0
Very well said Gregory 0
his face darkening you 0
shall see something more 0
serious than either drink 0
Syme stood waiting with 0
his usual air of 0
mildness until Gregory again 0
You spoke just now 0
of having a religion 0
Is it really true 0
that you have one 0
Oh said Syme with 0
a beaming smile we 0
are all Catholics now 0
Then may I ask 0
you to swear by 0
whatever gods or saints 0
your religion involves that 0
you will not reveal 0
what I am now 0
going to tell you 0
to any son of 0
Adam and especially not 0
Will you swear that 0
If you will take 0
upon yourself this awful 0
abnegations if you will 0
consent to burden your 0
soul with a vow 0
that you should never 0
make and a knowledge 0
you should never dream 0
about I will promise 0
You will promise me 0
inquired Syme as the 0
I will promise you 0
a very entertaining evening 0
Syme suddenly took off 0
Your offer he said 0
is far too idiotic 0
You say that a 0
poet is always an 0
but I hope at 0
least that he is 0
Permit me here and 0
now to swear as 0
a Christian and promise 0
as a good comrade 0
and a fellow artist 0
that I will not 0
report anything of this 0
whatever it is to 0
And now in the 0
name of Colney Hatch 0
I think said Gregory 0
with placid irrelevancy that 0
we will call a 0
He gave two long 0
whistles and a hansom 0
came rattling down the 0
The two got into 0
Gregory gave through the 0
trap the address of 0
an obscure public house 0
on the Chiswick bank 0
The cab whisked itself 0
away again and in 0
it these two fantastics 0
quitted their fantastic town 0
CHAPTER II THE SECRET 0
THE cab pulled up 0
before a particularly dreary 0
and greasy beershop into 0
which Gregory rapidly conducted 0
They seated themselves in 0
a close and dim 0
sort of bar parlour 0
at a stained wooden 0
table with one wooden 0
The room was so 0
small and dark that 0
very little could be 0
seen of the attendant 0
who was summoned beyond 0
a vague and dark 0
impression of something bulky 0
Will you take a 0
The pate de foie 0
gras is not good 0
here but I can 0
Syme received the remark 0
with stolidity imagining it 0
to be a joke 0
Accepting the vein of 0
humour he said with 0
a well bred indifference 0
Oh bring me some 0
To his indescribable astonishment 0
the man only said 0
and went away apparently 0
What will you drink 0
resumed Gregory with the 0
same careless yet apologetic 0
I shall only have 0
a crepe de menthe 0
But the champagne can 0
Do let me start 0
you with a half 0
bottle of Pommery at 0
said the motionless Syme 0
You are very good 0
His further attempts at 0
conversation somewhat disorganised in 0
themselves were cut short 0
finally as by a 0
thunderbolt by the actual 0
appearance of the lobster 0
Syme tasted it and 0
found it particularly good 0
Then he suddenly began 0
to eat with great 0
Excuse me if I 0
enjoy myself rather obviously 0
he said to Gregory 0
I don t often 0
have the luck to 0
have a dream like 0
It is new to 0
me for a nightmare 0
to lead to a 0
It is commonly the 0
You are not asleep 0
I assure you said 0
You are on the 0
contrary close to the 0
most actual and rousing 0
moment of your existence 0
Ah here comes your 0
I admit that there 0
may be a slight 0
disproportion let us say 0
between the inner arrangements 0
of this excellent hotel 0
and its simple and 0
But that is all 0
We are the most 0
modest men that ever 0
And who are we 0
asked Syme emptying his 0
It is quite simple 0
We are the serious 0
anarchists in whom you 0
You do yourselves well 0
Yes we are serious 0
about everything answered Gregory 0
Then after a pause 0
If in a few 0
moments this table begins 0
to turn round a 0
little don t put 0
it down to your 0
inroads into the champagne 0
I don t wish 0
you to do yourself 0
Well if I am 0
not drunk I am 0
mad replied Syme with 0
but I trust I 0
can behave like a 0
gentleman in either condition 0
said Gregory producing a 0
Try one of mine 0
Syme took the cigar 0
clipped the end off 0
with a cigar cutter 0
out of his waistcoat 0
pocket put it in 0
his mouth lit it 0
slowly and let out 0
a long cloud of 0
It is not a 0
little to his credit 0
that he performed these 0
rites with so much 0
composure for almost before 0
he had begun them 0
the table at which 0
he sat had begun 0
to revolve first slowly 0
and then rapidly as 0
if at an insane 0
You must not mind 0
it s a kind 0
Quite so said Syme 0
placidly a kind of 0
How simple that is 0
The next moment the 0
smoke of his cigar 0
which had been wavering 0
across the room in 0
snaky twists went straight 0
up as if from 0
a factory chimney and 0
the two with their 0
chairs and table shot 0
down through the floor 0
as if the earth 0
They went rattling down 0
a kind of roaring 0
chimney as rapidly as 0
a lift cut loose 0
and they came with 0
an abrupt bump to 0
But when Gregory threw 0
open a pair of 0
doors and let in 0
a red subterranean light 0
Syme was still smoking 0
with one leg thrown 0
over the other and 0
had not turned a 0
Gregory led him down 0
a low vaulted passage 0
at the end of 0
which was the red 0
It was an enormous 0
crimson lantern nearly as 0
big as a fireplace 0
fixed over a small 0
but heavy iron door 0
In the door there 0
was a sort of 0
hatchway or grating and 0
on this Gregory struck 0
A heavy voice with 0
a foreign accent asked 0
him who he was 0
To this he gave 0
the more or less 0
unexpected reply Mr Joseph 0
The heavy hinges began 0
it was obviously some 0
Inside the doorway the 0
passage gleamed as if 0
it were lined with 0
a network of steel 0
On a second glance 0
Syme saw that the 0
glittering pattern was really 0
made up of ranks 0
and ranks of rifles 0
and revolvers closely packed 0
I must ask you 0
to forgive me all 0
these formalities said Gregory 0
we have to be 0
Oh don t apologise 0
I know your passion 0
for law and order 0
and he stepped into 0
the passage lined with 0
With his long fair 0
hair and rather foppish 0
frock coat he looked 0
a singularly frail and 0
fanciful figure as he 0
walked down that shining 0
They passed through several 0
such passages and came 0
out at last into 0
a queer steel chamber 0
with curved walls almost 0
spherical in shape but 0
presenting with its tiers 0
of benches something of 0
the appearance of a 0
There were no rifles 0
or pistols in this 0
apartment but round the 0
walls of it were 0
hung more dubious and 0
dreadful shapes things that 0
looked like the bulbs 0
of iron plants or 0
the eggs of iron 0
They were bombs and 0
the very room itself 0
seemed like the inside 0
Syme knocked his cigar 0
ash off against the 0
wall and went in 0
And now my dear 0
Mr Syme said Gregory 0
throwing himself in an 0
expansive manner on the 0
bench under the largest 0
bomb now we are 0
quite cosy so let 0
Now no human words 0
can give you any 0
notion of why I 0
It was one of 0
those quite arbitrary emotions 0
like jumping off a 0
cliff or falling in 0
Suffice it to say 0
that you were an 0
inexpressibly irritating fellow and 0
to do you justice 0
I would break twenty 0
oaths of secrecy for 0
the pleasure of taking 0
you down a peg 0
That way you have 0
of lighting a cigar 0
would make a priest 0
break the seal of 0
Well you said that 0
you were quite certain 0
I was not a 0
Does this place strike 0
you as being serious 0
It does seem to 0
have a moral under 0
all its gaiety assented 0
but may I ask 0
You need not fear 0
to give me information 0
because as you remember 0
you very wisely extorted 0
from me a promise 0
not to tell the 0
police a promise I 0
So it is in 0
mere curiosity that I 0
First of all what 0
is it really all 0
What is it you 0
You want to abolish 0
said Gregory opening the 0
eyes of a fanatic 0
We do not only 0
want to upset a 0
few despotisms and police 0
that sort of anarchism 0
does exist but it 0
is a mere branch 0
We dig deeper and 0
we blow you higher 0
We wish to deny 0
all those arbitrary distinctions 0
of vice and virtue 0
honour and treachery upon 0
which mere rebels base 0
The silly sentimentalists of 0
the French Revolution talked 0
of the Rights of 0
We hate Rights as 0
We have abolished Right 0
And Right and Left 0
said Syme with a 0
simple eagerness I hope 0
you will abolish them 0
They are much more 0
You spoke of a 0
second question snapped Gregory 0
With pleasure resumed Syme 0
In all your present 0
acts and surroundings there 0
is a scientific attempt 0
I have an aunt 0
who lived over a 0
shop but this is 0
the first time I 0
have found people living 0
from preference under a 0
You have a heavy 0
You cannot pass it 0
without submitting to the 0
humiliation of calling yourself 0
You surround yourself with 0
steel instruments which make 0
the place if I 0
may say so more 0
May I ask why 0
after taking all this 0
trouble to barricade yourselves 0
in the bowels of 0
the earth you then 0
parade your whole secret 0
by talking about anarchism 0
to every silly woman 0
The answer is simple 0
I told you I 0
was a serious anarchist 0
and you did not 0
Nor do they believe 0
Unless I took them 0
into this infernal room 0
they would not believe 0
Syme smoked thoughtfully and 0
looked at him with 0
The history of the 0
thing might amuse you 0
When first I became 0
one of the New 0
Anarchists I tried all 0
kinds of respectable disguises 0
I dressed up as 0
I read up all 0
about bishops in our 0
anarchist pamphlets in Superstition 0
the Vampire and Priests 0
I certainly understood from 0
them that bishops are 0
strange and terrible old 0
men keeping a cruel 0
When on my first 0
appearing in episcopal gaiters 0
in a drawing room 0
I cried out in 0
a voice of thunder 0
they found out in 0
some way that I 0
was not a bishop 0
I was nabbed at 0
Then I made up 0
but I defended Capital 0
with so much intelligence 0
that a fool could 0
see that I was 0
Then I tried being 0
Now I am a 0
humanitarian myself but I 0
have I hope enough 0
intellectual breadth to understand 0
the position of those 0
who like Nietzsche admire 0
violence the proud mad 0
war of Nature and 0
all that you know 0
I threw myself into 0
I drew my sword 0
and waved it constantly 0
I called out Blood 0
abstractedly like a man 0
I often said Let 0
it is the Law 0
Well well it seems 0
majors don t do 0
I was nabbed again 0
At last I went 0
in despair to the 0
President of the Central 0
Anarchist Council who is 0
the greatest man in 0
What is his name 0
You would not know 0
That is his greatness 0
Caesar and Napoleon put 0
all their genius into 0
being heard of and 0
they were heard of 0
He puts all his 0
genius into not being 0
heard of and he 0
is not heard of 0
But you cannot be 0
for five minutes in 0
the room with him 0
without feeling that Caesar 0
and Napoleon would have 0
been children in his 0
He was silent and 0
even pale for a 0
moment and then resumed 0
But whenever he gives 0
advice it is always 0
something as startling as 0
an epigram and yet 0
as practical as the 0
I said to him 0
What disguise will hide 0
me from the world 0
What can I find 0
more respectable than bishops 0
He looked at me 0
with his large but 0
You want a safe 0
You want a dress 0
which will guarantee you 0
a dress in which 0
no one would ever 0
look for a bomb 0
He suddenly lifted his 0
Why then dress up 0
as an anarchist you 0
he roared so that 0
Nobody will ever expect 0
you to do anything 0
And he turned his 0
broad back on me 0
I took his advice 0
and have never regretted 0
I preached blood and 0
murder to those women 0
day and night and 0
would let me wheel 0
Syme sat watching him 0
with some respect in 0
his large blue eyes 0
You took me in 0
It is really a 0
Then after a pause 0
What do you call 0
this tremendous President of 0
We generally call him 0
Sunday replied Gregory with 0
You see there are 0
seven members of the 0
Central Anarchist Council and 0
they are named after 0
days of the week 0
He is called Sunday 0
by some of his 0
It is curious you 0
should mention the matter 0
because the very night 0
you have dropped in 0
if I may so 0
is the night on 0
which our London branch 0
which assembles in this 0
room has to elect 0
its own deputy to 0
fill a vacancy in 0
The gentleman who has 0
for some time past 0
played with propriety and 0
general applause the difficult 0
part of Thursday has 0
Consequently we have called 0
a meeting this very 0
evening to elect a 0
He got to his 0
feet and strolled across 0
the room with a 0
sort of smiling embarrassment 0
I feel somehow as 0
if you were my 0
mother Syme he continued 0
I feel that I 0
can confide anything to 0
you as you have 0
promised to tell nobody 0
In fact I will 0
confide to you something 0
that I would not 0
say in so many 0
words to the anarchists 0
who will be coming 0
to the room in 0
We shall of course 0
go through a form 0
but I don t 0
mind telling you that 0
it is practically certain 0
what the result will 0
He looked down for 0
It is almost a 0
settled thing that I 0
am to be Thursday 0
said Syme heartily I 0
Gregory smiled in deprecation 0
and walked across the 0
As a matter of 0
fact everything is ready 0
for me on this 0
table he said and 0
the ceremony will probably 0
be the shortest possible 0
Syme also strolled across 0
to the table and 0
found lying across it 0
a walking stick which 0
turned out on examination 0
to be a sword 0
stick a large Colt 0
s revolver a sandwich 0
case and a formidable 0
Over the chair beside 0
the table was thrown 0
a heavy looking cape 0
I have only to 0
get the form of 0
election finished continued Gregory 0
with animation then I 0
snatch up this cloak 0
and stick stuff these 0
other things into my 0
pocket step out of 0
a door in this 0
cavern which opens on 0
the river where there 0
is a steam tug 0
already waiting for me 0
and then then oh 0
the wild joy of 0
And he clasped his 0
Syme who had sat 0
down once more with 0
his usual insolent languor 0
got to his feet 0
with an unusual air 0
Why is it he 0
asked vaguely that I 0
think you are quite 0
Why do I positively 0
He paused a moment 0
and then added with 0
a sort of fresh 0
curiosity Is it because 0
you are such an 0
There was a thoughtful 0
silence again and then 0
Well damn it all 0
this is the funniest 0
situation I have ever 0
been in in my 0
life and I am 0
going to act accordingly 0
Gregory I gave you 0
a promise before I 0
came into this place 0
That promise I would 0
keep under red hot 0
Would you give me 0
for my own safety 0
a little promise of 0
Yes said Syme very 0
I swore before God 0
that I would not 0
tell your secret to 0
Will you swear by 0
Humanity or whatever beastly 0
thing you believe in 0
that you will not 0
tell my secret to 0
asked the staring Gregory 0
Have you got a 0
Yes said Syme I 0
Then after a pause 0
Gregory glared at him 0
gravely for a few 0
moments and then said 0
You must have bewitched 0
me but I feel 0
a furious curiosity about 0
Yes I will swear 0
not to tell the 0
anarchists anything you tell 0
But look sharp for 0
they will be here 0
in a couple of 0
Syme rose slowly to 0
his feet and thrust 0
his long white hands 0
into his long grey 0
Almost as he did 0
so there came five 0
knocks on the outer 0
grating proclaiming the arrival 0
of the first of 0
Well said Syme slowly 0
I don t know 0
how to tell you 0
the truth more shortly 0
than by saying that 0
your expedient of dressing 0
up as an aimless 0
poet is not confined 0
to you or your 0
We have known the 0
dodge for some time 0
Gregory tried to spring 0
up straight but he 0
What do you say 0
he asked in an 0
Yes said Syme simply 0
I am a police 0
But I think I 0
hear your friends coming 0
From the doorway there 0
came a murmur of 0
It was repeated twice 0
and thrice and then 0
thirty times and the 0
crowd of Joseph Chamberlains 0
could be heard trampling 0
CHAPTER III THE MAN 0
BEFORE one of the 0
fresh faces could appear 0
at the doorway Gregory 0
s stunned surprise had 0
He was beside the 0
table with a bound 0
and a noise in 0
his throat like a 0
He caught up the 0
Colt s revolver and 0
took aim at Syme 0
Syme did not flinch 0
but he put up 0
a pale and polite 0
Don t be such 0
a silly man he 0
said with the effeminate 0
dignity of a curate 0
Don t you see 0
it s not necessary 0
Don t you see 0
that we re both 0
in the same boat 0
Yes and jolly sea 0
Gregory could not speak 0
but he could not 0
fire either and he 0
Don t you see 0
we ve checkmated each 0
I can t tell 0
the police you are 0
You can t tell 0
the anarchists I m 0
I can only watch 0
you knowing what you 0
you can only watch 0
me knowing what I 0
In short it s 0
a lonely intellectual duel 0
my head against yours 0
I m a policeman 0
deprived of the help 0
You my poor fellow 0
are an anarchist deprived 0
of the help of 0
that law and organisation 0
which is so essential 0
The one solitary difference 0
is in your favour 0
You are not surrounded 0
I am surrounded by 0
I cannot betray you 0
but I might betray 0
wait and see me 0
I shall do it 0
Gregory put the pistol 0
slowly down still staring 0
at Syme as if 0
he were a sea 0
I don t believe 0
in immortality he said 0
at last but if 0
after all this you 0
were to break your 0
word God would make 0
a hell only for 0
you to howl in 0
I shall not break 0
my word said Syme 0
sternly nor will you 0
Here are your friends 0
The mass of the 0
anarchists entered the room 0
heavily with a slouching 0
and somewhat weary gait 0
but one little man 0
with a black beard 0
and glasses a man 0
somewhat of the type 0
of Mr Tim Healy 0
detached himself and bustled 0
forward with some papers 0
Comrade Gregory he said 0
I suppose this man 0
Gregory taken by surprise 0
looked down and muttered 0
the name of Syme 0
but Syme replied almost 0
I am glad to 0
see that your gate 0
is well enough guarded 0
to make it hard 0
for anyone to be 0
here who was not 0
The brow of the 0
little man with the 0
black beard was however 0
still contracted with something 0
What branch do you 0
I should hardly call 0
it a branch said 0
I should call it 0
at the very least 0
What do you mean 0
The fact is said 0
Syme serenely the truth 0
is I am a 0
I have been specially 0
sent here to see 0
that you show a 0
due observance of Sunday 0
The little man dropped 0
one of his papers 0
and a flicker of 0
fear went over all 0
the faces of the 0
Evidently the awful President 0
whose name was Sunday 0
did sometimes send down 0
such irregular ambassadors to 0
Well comrade said the 0
man with the papers 0
after a pause I 0
suppose we d better 0
give you a seat 0
If you ask my 0
advice as a friend 0
said Syme with severe 0
benevolence I think you 0
When Gregory heard the 0
dangerous dialogue end with 0
a sudden safety for 0
his rival he rose 0
abruptly and paced the 0
floor in painful thought 0
He was indeed in 0
an agony of diplomacy 0
It was clear that 0
Syme s inspired impudence 0
was likely to bring 0
him out of all 0
Little was to be 0
He could not himself 0
betray Syme partly from 0
honour but partly also 0
because if he betrayed 0
him and for some 0
reason failed to destroy 0
him the Syme who 0
escaped would be a 0
Syme freed from all 0
obligation of secrecy a 0
Syme who would simply 0
walk to the nearest 0
After all it was 0
only one night s 0
discussion and only one 0
detective who would know 0
He would let out 0
as little as possible 0
of their plans that 0
night and then let 0
Syme go and chance 0
He strode across to 0
the group of anarchists 0
which was already distributing 0
itself along the benches 0
I think it is 0
time we began he 0
the steam tug is 0
waiting on the river 0
I move that Comrade 0
Buttons takes the chair 0
This being approved by 0
a show of hands 0
the little man with 0
the papers slipped into 0
Comrades he began as 0
sharp as a pistol 0
shot our meeting tonight 0
is important though it 0
need not be long 0
This branch has always 0
had the honour of 0
electing Thursdays for the 0
We have elected many 0
We all lament the 0
sad decease of the 0
heroic worker who occupied 0
the post until last 0
As you know his 0
services to the cause 0
He organised the great 0
dynamite coup of Brighton 0
which under happier circumstances 0
ought to have killed 0
everybody on the pier 0
As you also know 0
his death was as 0
self denying as his 0
life for he died 0
through his faith in 0
a hygienic mixture of 0
chalk and water as 0
a substitute for milk 0
which beverage he regarded 0
as barbaric and as 0
involving cruelty to the 0
Cruelty or anything approaching 0
to cruelty revolted him 0
But it is not 0
to acclaim his virtues 0
that we are met 0
but for a harder 0
It is difficult properly 0
to praise his qualities 0
but it is more 0
difficult to replace them 0
Upon you comrades it 0
devolves this evening to 0
choose out of the 0
company present the man 0
who shall be Thursday 0
If any comrade suggests 0
a name I will 0
put it to the 0
If no comrade suggests 0
a name I can 0
only tell myself that 0
that dear dynamiter who 0
is gone from us 0
has carried into the 0
unknowable abysses the last 0
secret of his virtue 0
There was a stir 0
of almost inaudible applause 0
such as is sometimes 0
Then a large old 0
man with a long 0
and venerable white beard 0
perhaps the only real 0
working man present rose 0
I move that Comrade 0
Gregory be elected Thursday 0
and sat lumberingly down 0
A little man with 0
a velvet coat and 0
Before I put the 0
matter to the vote 0
said the chairman I 0
will call on Comrade 0
Gregory to make a 0
Gregory rose amid a 0
great rumble of applause 0
His face was deadly 0
pale so that by 0
contrast his queer red 0
hair looked almost scarlet 0
But he was smiling 0
and altogether at ease 0
He had made up 0
his mind and he 0
saw his best policy 0
quite plain in front 0
of him like a 0
His best chance was 0
to make a softened 0
and ambiguous speech such 0
as would leave on 0
the detective s mind 0
the impression that the 0
anarchist brotherhood was a 0
very mild affair after 0
He believed in his 0
own literary power his 0
capacity for suggesting fine 0
shades and picking perfect 0
He thought that with 0
care he could succeed 0
in spite of all 0
the people around him 0
in conveying an impression 0
of the institution subtly 0
Syme had once thought 0
that anarchists under all 0
their bravado were only 0
Could he not now 0
in the hour of 0
peril make Syme think 0
Comrades began Gregory in 0
a low but penetrating 0
voice it is not 0
necessary for me to 0
tell you what is 0
my policy for it 0
is your policy also 0
Our belief has been 0
slandered it has been 0
disfigured it has been 0
utterly confused and concealed 0
but it has never 0
Those who talk about 0
anarchism and its dangers 0
go everywhere and anywhere 0
to get their information 0
except to us except 0
to the fountain head 0
They learn about anarchists 0
they learn about anarchists 0
from tradesmen s newspapers 0
they learn about anarchists 0
from Ally Sloper s 0
Half Holiday and the 0
They never learn about 0
We have no chance 0
of denying the mountainous 0
slanders which are heaped 0
upon our heads from 0
one end of Europe 0
The man who has 0
always heard that we 0
are walking plagues has 0
never heard our reply 0
I know that he 0
will not hear it 0
tonight though my passion 0
were to rend the 0
For it is deep 0
deep under the earth 0
that the persecuted are 0
permitted to assemble as 0
the Christians assembled in 0
But if by some 0
incredible accident there were 0
here tonight a man 0
who all his life 0
had thus immensely misunderstood 0
us I would put 0
this question to him 0
When those Christians met 0
in those Catacombs what 0
sort of moral reputation 0
had they in the 0
What tales were told 0
of their atrocities by 0
one educated Roman to 0
I would say to 0
suppose that we are 0
only repeating that still 0
mysterious paradox of history 0
Suppose we seem as 0
shocking as the Christians 0
because we are really 0
as harmless as the 0
Suppose we seem as 0
mad as the Christians 0
because we are really 0
The applause that had 0
greeted the opening sentences 0
had been gradually growing 0
fainter and at the 0
last word it stopped 0
In the abrupt silence 0
the man with the 0
velvet jacket said in 0
a high squeaky voice 0
I m not meek 0
Comrade Witherspoon tells us 0
resumed Gregory that he 0
Ah how little he 0
His words are indeed 0
his appearance is ferocious 0
to an ordinary taste 0
But only the eye 0
of a friendship as 0
deep and delicate as 0
mine can perceive the 0
deep foundation of solid 0
meekness which lies at 0
the base of him 0
too deep even for 0
I repeat we are 0
the true early Christians 0
only that we come 0
We are simple as 0
they revere simple look 0
We are modest as 0
they were modest look 0
called out Mr Witherspoon 0
with the velvet jacket 0
I say we are 0
merciful repeated Gregory furiously 0
as the early Christians 0
Yet this did not 0
prevent their being accused 0
of eating human flesh 0
We do not eat 0
Comrade Witherspoon said Gregory 0
with a feverish gaiety 0
is anxious to know 0
why nobody eats him 0
In our society at 0
any rate which loves 0
him sincerely which is 0
said Witherspoon down with 0
Which is founded upon 0
love repeated Gregory grinding 0
his teeth there will 0
be no difficulty about 0
the aims which we 0
shall pursue as a 0
body or which I 0
should pursue were I 0
chosen as the representative 0
Superbly careless of the 0
slanders that represent us 0
as assassins and enemies 0
of human society we 0
shall pursue with moral 0
courage and quiet intellectual 0
pressure the permanent ideals 0
of brotherhood and simplicity 0
Gregory resumed his seat 0
and passed his hand 0
The silence was sudden 0
and awkward but the 0
chairman rose like an 0
automaton and said in 0
Does anyone oppose the 0
election of Comrade Gregory 0
The assembly seemed vague 0
and sub consciously disappointed 0
and Comrade Witherspoon moved 0
restlessly on his seat 0
and muttered in his 0
By the sheer rush 0
of routine however the 0
motion would have been 0
But as the chairman 0
was opening his mouth 0
to put it Syme 0
sprang to his feet 0
and said in a 0
small and quiet voice 0
Yes Mr Chairman I 0
The most effective fact 0
in oratory is an 0
unexpected change in the 0
Mr Gabriel Syme evidently 0
Having said these first 0
formal words in a 0
moderated tone and with 0
a brief simplicity he 0
made his next word 0
ring and volley in 0
the vault as if 0
one of the guns 0
he cried in a 0
voice that made every 0
man jump out of 0
his boots have we 0
come here for this 0
Do we live underground 0
like rats in order 0
to listen to talk 0
This is talk we 0
might listen to while 0
eating buns at a 0
Do we line these 0
walls with weapons and 0
bar that door with 0
death lest anyone should 0
come and hear Comrade 0
Gregory saying to us 0
Be good and you 0
will be happy Honesty 0
is the best policy 0
and Virtue is its 0
There was not a 0
word in Comrade Gregory 0
s address to which 0
a curate could not 0
have listened with pleasure 0
But I am not 0
and I did not 0
listen to it with 0
The man who is 0
fitted to make a 0
good curate is not 0
fitted to make a 0
resolute forcible and efficient 0
Comrade Gregory has told 0
us in only too 0
apologetic a tone that 0
we are not the 0
But I say that 0
we are the enemies 0
of society and so 0
much the worse for 0
We are the enemies 0
of society for society 0
is the enemy of 0
humanity its oldest and 0
its most pitiless enemy 0
Comrade Gregory has told 0
that we are not 0
We are not murderers 0
Ever since Syme had 0
risen Gregory had sat 0
staring at him his 0
face idiotic with astonishment 0
Now in the pause 0
his lips of clay 0
parted and he said 0
with an automatic and 0
Syme looked straight into 0
those frightful eyes with 0
his own pale blue 0
ones and said with 0
Comrade Gregory accuses me 0
He knows as well 0
as I do that 0
I am keeping all 0
my engagements and doing 0
nothing but my duty 0
I do not mince 0
I do not pretend 0
I say that Comrade 0
Gregory is unfit to 0
be Thursday for all 0
He is unfit to 0
be Thursday because of 0
We do not want 0
the Supreme Council of 0
Anarchy infected with a 0
This is no time 0
for ceremonial politeness neither 0
is it a time 0
I set myself against 0
Comrade Gregory as I 0
would set myself against 0
all the Governments of 0
Europe because the anarchist 0
who has given himself 0
to anarchy has forgotten 0
modesty as much as 0
he has forgotten pride 0
I am not a 0
I am a cause 0
I set myself against 0
Comrade Gregory as impersonally 0
and as calmly as 0
I should choose one 0
pistol rather than another 0
out of that rack 0
and I say that 0
rather than have Gregory 0
and his milk and 0
water methods on the 0
Supreme Council I would 0
offer myself for election 0
His sentence was drowned 0
in a deafening cataract 0
The faces that had 0
grown fiercer and fiercer 0
with approval as his 0
tirade grew more and 0
more uncompromising were now 0
distorted with grins of 0
anticipation or cloven with 0
At the moment when 0
he announced himself as 0
ready to stand for 0
the post of Thursday 0
a roar of excitement 0
and assent broke forth 0
and became uncontrollable and 0
at the same moment 0
Gregory sprang to his 0
feet with foam upon 0
his mouth and shouted 0
Stop you blasted madmen 0
he cried at the 0
top of a voice 0
that tore his throat 0
But louder than Gregory 0
s shouting and louder 0
than the roar of 0
the room came the 0
voice of Syme still 0
speaking in a peal 0
I do not go 0
to the Council to 0
rebut that slander that 0
I go to earn 0
loud and prolonged cheering 0
To the priest who 0
says these men are 0
the enemies of religion 0
to the judge who 0
says these men are 0
the enemies of law 0
to the fat parliamentarian 0
who says these men 0
are the enemies of 0
order and public decency 0
to all these I 0
will reply You are 0
false kings but you 0
I am come to 0
destroy you and to 0
The heavy clamour gradually 0
died away but before 0
it had ceased Witherspoon 0
had jumped to his 0
feet his hair and 0
beard all on end 0
I move as an 0
amendment that Comrade Syme 0
be appointed to the 0
Stop all this I 0
cried Gregory with frantic 0
Stop it it is 0
The voice of the 0
chairman clove his speech 0
with a cold accent 0
Does anyone second this 0
A tall tired man 0
with melancholy eyes and 0
an American chin beard 0
was observed on the 0
back bench to be 0
slowly rising to his 0
Gregory had been screaming 0
for some time past 0
now there was a 0
change in his accent 0
more shocking than any 0
I end all this 0
he said in a 0
voice as heavy as 0
This man cannot be 0
Yes said Syme quite 0
motionless what is he 0
Gregory s mouth worked 0
then slowly the blood 0
began to crawl back 0
into his dead face 0
He is a man 0
quite inexperienced in our 0
work he said and 0
Before he had done 0
so the long lean 0
man with the American 0
beard was again upon 0
his feet and was 0
repeating in a high 0
I beg to second 0
the election of Comrade 0
The amendment will as 0
usual be put first 0
said Mr Buttons the 0
chairman with mechanical rapidity 0
The question is that 0
Gregory had again sprung 0
to his feet panting 0
Comrades he cried out 0
I am not a 0
I am not a 0
madman reiterated Gregory with 0
a frightful sincerity which 0
for a moment staggered 0
the room but I 0
give you a counsel 0
which you can call 0
mad if you like 0
No I will not 0
call it a counsel 0
for I can give 0
you no reason for 0
I will call it 0
Call it a mad 0
command but act upon 0
Strike but hear me 0
Kill me but obey 0
Do not elect this 0
Truth is so terrible 0
even in fetters that 0
for a moment Syme 0
s slender and insane 0
victory swayed like a 0
But you could not 0
have guessed it from 0
Syme s bleak blue 0
Then the spell was 0
snapped and one anarchist 0
called out to Gregory 0
You are not Sunday 0
and another anarchist added 0
in a heavier voice 0
And you are not 0
Comrades cried Gregory in 0
a voice like that 0
of a martyr who 0
in an ecstacy of 0
pain has passed beyond 0
pain it is nothing 0
to me whether you 0
detest me as a 0
tyrant or detest me 0
If you will not 0
take my command accept 0
I kneel to you 0
I throw myself at 0
Do not elect this 0
Comrade Gregory said the 0
chairman after a painful 0
pause this is really 0
For the first time 0
in the proceedings there 0
was for a few 0
seconds a real silence 0
Then Gregory fell back 0
in his seat a 0
pale wreck of a 0
man and the chairman 0
repeated like a piece 0
of clock work suddenly 0
The question is that 0
Comrade Syme be elected 0
to the post of 0
Thursday on the General 0
The roar rose like 0
the sea the hands 0
rose like a forest 0
and three minutes afterwards 0
Mr Gabriel Syme of 0
the Secret Police Service 0
was elected to the 0
post of Thursday on 0
the General Council of 0
the Anarchists of Europe 0
Everyone in the room 0
seemed to feel the 0
tug waiting on the 0
river the sword stick 0
and the revolver waiting 0
The instant the election 0
was ended and irrevocable 0
and Syme had received 0
the paper proving his 0
election they all sprang 0
to their feet and 0
the fiery groups moved 0
and mixed in the 0
Syme found himself somehow 0
or other face to 0
face with Gregory who 0
still regarded him with 0
a stare of stunned 0
They were silent for 0
You are a devil 0
said Gregory at last 0
And you are a 0
gentleman said Syme with 0
It was you that 0
entrapped me began Gregory 0
shaking from head to 0
foot entrapped me into 0
Talk sense said Syme 0
Into what sort of 0
devils parliament have you 0
entrapped me if it 0
You made me swear 0
before I made you 0
Perhaps we are both 0
doing what we think 0
But what we think 0
right is so damned 0
different that there can 0
be nothing between us 0
in the way of 0
There is nothing possible 0
between us but honour 0
and death and he 0
pulled the great cloak 0
about his shoulders and 0
picked up the flask 0
The boat is quite 0
ready said Mr Buttons 0
Be good enough to 0
With a gesture that 0
revealed the shop walker 0
he led Syme down 0
a short iron bound 0
passage the still agonised 0
Gregory following feverishly at 0
At the end of 0
the passage was a 0
door which Buttons opened 0
sharply showing a sudden 0
blue and silver picture 0
of the moonlit river 0
that looked like a 0
scene in a theatre 0
Close to the opening 0
lay a dark dwarfish 0
steam launch like a 0
baby dragon with one 0
Almost in the act 0
of stepping on board 0
Gabriel Syme turned to 0
You have kept your 0
word he said gently 0
with his face in 0
You are a man 0
of honour and I 0
You have kept it 0
even down to a 0
There was one special 0
thing you promised me 0
at the beginning of 0
the affair and which 0
you have certainly given 0
me by the end 0
What do you mean 0
cried the chaotic Gregory 0
What did I promise 0
A very entertaining evening 0
said Syme and he 0
made a military salute 0
with the sword stick 0
as the steamboat slid 0
CHAPTER IV THE TALE 0
GABRIEL SYME was not 0
merely a detective who 0
pretended to be a 0
he was really a 0
poet who had become 0
Nor was his hatred 0
He was one of 0
those who are driven 0
early in life into 0
too conservative an attitude 0
by the bewildering folly 0
He had not attained 0
it by any tame 0
His respectability was spontaneous 0
and sudden a rebellion 0
He came of a 0
family of cranks in 0
which all the oldest 0
people had all the 0
One of his uncles 0
always walked about without 0
a hat and another 0
had made an unsuccessful 0
attempt to walk about 0
with a hat and 0
His father cultivated art 0
his mother went in 0
for simplicity and hygiene 0
Hence the child during 0
his tenderer years was 0
wholly unacquainted with any 0
drink between the extremes 0
of absinth and cocoa 0
of both of which 0
he had a healthy 0
The more his mother 0
preached a more than 0
Puritan abstinence the more 0
did his father expand 0
into a more than 0
and by the time 0
the former had come 0
to enforcing vegetarianism the 0
latter had pretty well 0
reached the point of 0
Being surrounded with every 0
conceivable kind of revolt 0
from infancy Gabriel had 0
to revolt into something 0
so he revolted into 0
the only thing left 0
But there was just 0
enough in him of 0
the blood of these 0
fanatics to make even 0
his protest for common 0
sense a little too 0
fierce to be sensible 0
His hatred of modern 0
lawlessness had been crowned 0
also by an accident 0
It happened that he 0
was walking in a 0
side street at the 0
instant of a dynamite 0
He had been blind 0
and deaf for a 0
moment and then seen 0
the smoke clearing the 0
broken windows and the 0
After that he went 0
about as usual quiet 0
but there was a 0
spot on his mind 0
that was not sane 0
He did not regard 0
anarchists as most of 0
us do as a 0
handful of morbid men 0
combining ignorance with intellectualism 0
He regarded them as 0
a huge and pitiless 0
peril like a Chinese 0
He poured perpetually into 0
newspapers and their waste 0
paper baskets a torrent 0
of tales verses and 0
violent articles warning men 0
of this deluge of 0
But he seemed to 0
be getting no nearer 0
his enemy and what 0
was worse no nearer 0
As he paced the 0
Thames embankment bitterly biting 0
a cheap cigar and 0
brooding on the advance 0
of Anarchy there was 0
no anarchist with a 0
bomb in his pocket 0
so savage or so 0
Indeed he always felt 0
that Government stood alone 0
and desperate with its 0
back to the wall 0
He was too quixotic 0
to have cared for 0
He walked on the 0
Embankment once under a 0
The red river reflected 0
the red sky and 0
they both reflected his 0
The sky indeed was 0
so swarthy and the 0
light on the river 0
relatively so lurid that 0
the water almost seemed 0
of fiercer flame than 0
the sunset it mirrored 0
It looked like a 0
stream of literal fire 0
winding under the vast 0
caverns of a subterranean 0
Syme was shabby in 0
He wore an old 0
fashioned black chimney pot 0
he was wrapped in 0
a yet more old 0
fashioned cloak black and 0
and the combination gave 0
him the look of 0
the early villains in 0
Dickens and Bulwer Lytton 0
Also his yellow beard 0
and hair were more 0
unkempt and leonine than 0
when they appeared long 0
afterwards cut and pointed 0
on the lawns of 0
A long lean black 0
cigar bought in Soho 0
for twopence stood out 0
from between his tightened 0
teeth and altogether he 0
looked a very satisfactory 0
specimen of the anarchists 0
upon whom he had 0
vowed a holy war 0
Perhaps this was why 0
a policeman on the 0
Embankment spoke to him 0
and said Good evening 0
Syme at a crisis 0
of his morbid fears 0
for humanity seemed stung 0
by the mere stolidity 0
of the automatic official 0
a mere bulk of 0
blue in the twilight 0
A good evening is 0
You fellows would call 0
the end of the 0
world a good evening 0
Look at that bloody 0
red sun and that 0
I tell you that 0
if that were literally 0
human blood spilt and 0
shining you would still 0
be standing here as 0
solid as ever looking 0
out for some poor 0
harmless tramp whom you 0
You policemen are cruel 0
to the poor but 0
I could forgive you 0
even your cruelty if 0
it were not for 0
If we are calm 0
replied the policeman it 0
is the calm of 0
The soldier must be 0
calm in the thick 0
of the battle pursued 0
The composure of an 0
army is the anger 0
Good God the Board 0
Is this undenominational education 0
No said the policeman 0
sadly I never had 0
any of those advantages 0
The Board Schools came 0
What education I had 0
was very rough and 0
old fashioned I am 0
Where did you have 0
Oh at Harrow said 0
The class sympathies which 0
false as they are 0
are the truest things 0
in so many men 0
broke out of Syme 0
before he could control 0
But good Lord man 0
he said you oughtn 0
t to be a 0
The policeman sighed and 0
I know he said 0
solemnly I know I 0
But why did you 0
asked Syme with rude 0
For much the same 0
reason that you abused 0
the police replied the 0
I found that there 0
was a special opening 0
in the service for 0
those whose fears for 0
humanity were concerned rather 0
with the aberrations of 0
the scientific intellect than 0
with the normal and 0
excusable though excessive outbreaks 0
of the human will 0
I trust I make 0
If you mean that 0
you make your opinion 0
clear said Syme I 0
But as for making 0
yourself clear it is 0
the last thing you 0
How comes a man 0
like you to be 0
talking philosophy in a 0
blue helmet on the 0
You have evidently not 0
heard of the latest 0
development in our police 0
system replied the other 0
I am not surprised 0
We are keeping it 0
rather dark from the 0
educated class because that 0
class contains most of 0
But you seem to 0
be exactly in the 0
right frame of mind 0
I think you might 0
Join you in what 0
I will tell you 0
said the policeman slowly 0
This is the situation 0
The head of one 0
of our departments one 0
of the most celebrated 0
detectives in Europe has 0
long been of opinion 0
that a purely intellectual 0
conspiracy would soon threaten 0
the very existence of 0
He is certain that 0
the scientific and artistic 0
worlds are silently bound 0
in a crusade against 0
the Family and the 0
He has therefore formed 0
a special corps of 0
policemen policemen who are 0
It is their business 0
to watch the beginnings 0
of this conspiracy not 0
merely in a criminal 0
but in a controversial 0
I am a democrat 0
myself and I am 0
fully aware of the 0
value of the ordinary 0
man in matters of 0
ordinary valour or virtue 0
But it would obviously 0
be undesirable to employ 0
the common policeman in 0
an investigation which is 0
also a heresy hunt 0
Syme s eyes were 0
bright with a sympathetic 0
What do you do 0
The work of the 0
philosophical policeman replied the 0
man in blue is 0
at once bolder and 0
more subtle than that 0
of the ordinary detective 0
The ordinary detective goes 0
to pot houses to 0
we go to artistic 0
tea parties to detect 0
The ordinary detective discovers 0
from a ledger or 0
a diary that a 0
crime has been committed 0
We discover from a 0
book of sonnets that 0
a crime will be 0
We have to trace 0
the origin of those 0
dreadful thoughts that drive 0
men on at last 0
to intellectual fanaticism and 0
We were only just 0
in time to prevent 0
the assassination at Hartle 0
pool and that was 0
entirely due to the 0
fact that our Mr 0
a smart young fellow 0
thoroughly understood a triolet 0
Do you mean asked 0
Syme that there is 0
really as much connection 0
between crime and the 0
modern intellect as all 0
You are not sufficiently 0
democratic answered the policeman 0
but you were right 0
when you said just 0
now that our ordinary 0
treatment of the poor 0
criminal was a pretty 0
I tell you I 0
am sometimes sick of 0
my trade when I 0
see how perpetually it 0
means merely a war 0
upon the ignorant and 0
But this new movement 0
of ours is a 0
We deny the snobbish 0
English assumption that the 0
uneducated are the dangerous 0
We remember the Roman 0
We remember the great 0
poisoning princes of the 0
We say that the 0
dangerous criminal is the 0
We say that the 0
most dangerous criminal now 0
is the entirely lawless 0
Compared to him burglars 0
and bigamists are essentially 0
my heart goes out 0
They accept the essential 0
they merely seek it 0
They merely wish the 0
property to become their 0
property that they may 0
more perfectly respect it 0
But philosophers dislike property 0
they wish to destroy 0
the very idea of 0
Bigamists respect marriage or 0
they would not go 0
through the highly ceremonial 0
and even ritualistic formality 0
But philosophers despise marriage 0
Murderers respect human life 0
they merely wish to 0
attain a greater fulness 0
of human life in 0
themselves by the sacrifice 0
of what seems to 0
them to be lesser 0
But philosophers hate life 0
itself their own as 0
much as other people 0
Syme struck his hands 0
How true that is 0
I have felt it 0
from my boyhood but 0
never could state the 0
The common criminal is 0
a bad man but 0
at least he is 0
as it were a 0
He says that if 0
only a certain obstacle 0
be removed say a 0
wealthy uncle he is 0
then prepared to accept 0
the universe and to 0
He is a reformer 0
but not an anarchist 0
He wishes to cleanse 0
the edifice but not 0
But the evil philosopher 0
is not trying to 0
alter things but to 0
Yes the modern world 0
has retained all those 0
parts of police work 0
which are really oppressive 0
and ignominious the harrying 0
of the poor the 0
spying upon the unfortunate 0
It has given up 0
its more dignified work 0
the punishment of powerful 0
traitors the in the 0
State and powerful heresiarchs 0
The moderns say we 0
must not punish heretics 0
My only doubt is 0
whether we have a 0
right to punish anybody 0
But this is absurd 0
cried the policeman clasping 0
his hands with an 0
excitement uncommon in persons 0
of his figure and 0
costume but it is 0
I don t know 0
what you re doing 0
but you re wasting 0
You must you shall 0
join our special army 0
Their armies are on 0
Their bolt is ready 0
A moment more and 0
you may lose the 0
glory of working with 0
us perhaps the glory 0
of dying with the 0
last heroes of the 0
It is a chance 0
not to be missed 0
certainly assented Syme but 0
still I do not 0
I know as well 0
as anybody that the 0
modern world is full 0
of lawless little men 0
and mad little movements 0
But beastly as they 0
are they generally have 0
the one merit of 0
disagreeing with each other 0
How can you talk 0
of their leading one 0
army or hurling one 0
What is this anarchy 0
Do not confuse it 0
replied the constable with 0
those chance dynamite outbreaks 0
from Russia or from 0
Ireland which are really 0
the outbreaks of oppressed 0
This is a vast 0
philosophic movement consisting of 0
an outer and an 0
You might even call 0
the outer ring the 0
laity and the inner 0
I prefer to call 0
the outer ring the 0
innocent section the inner 0
ring the supremely guilty 0
The outer ring the 0
main mass of their 0
supporters are merely anarchists 0
that is men who 0
believe that rules and 0
formulas have destroyed human 0
They believe that all 0
the evil results of 0
human crime are the 0
results of the system 0
that has called it 0
They do not believe 0
that the crime creates 0
They believe that the 0
punishment has created the 0
They believe that if 0
a man seduced seven 0
women he would naturally 0
walk away as blameless 0
as the flowers of 0
They believe that if 0
a man picked a 0
pocket he would naturally 0
These I call the 0
Naturally therefore these people 0
talk about a happy 0
the paradise of the 0
mankind freed from the 0
bondage of vice and 0
the bondage of virtue 0
And so also the 0
men of the inner 0
circle speak the sacred 0
They also speak to 0
applauding crowds of the 0
happiness of the future 0
and of mankind freed 0
But in their mouths 0
and the policeman lowered 0
his voice in their 0
mouths these happy phrases 0
have a horrible meaning 0
They are under no 0
they are too intellectual 0
to think that man 0
upon this earth can 0
ever be quite free 0
of original sin and 0
And they mean death 0
When they say that 0
mankind shall be free 0
at last they mean 0
that mankind shall commit 0
When they talk of 0
a paradise without right 0
or wrong they mean 0
They have but two 0
objects to destroy first 0
humanity and then themselves 0
That is why they 0
throw bombs instead of 0
The innocent rank and 0
file are disappointed because 0
the bomb has not 0
but the high priesthood 0
are happy because it 0
How can I join 0
asked Syme with a 0
I know for a 0
fact that there is 0
a vacancy at the 0
moment said the policeman 0
as I have the 0
honour to be somewhat 0
in the confidence of 0
the chief of whom 0
You should really come 0
Or rather I should 0
not say see him 0
nobody ever sees him 0
but you can talk 0
to him if you 0
inquired Syme with interest 0
No said the policeman 0
placidly he has a 0
fancy for always sitting 0
in a pitch dark 0
He says it makes 0
Somewhat dazed and considerably 0
excited Syme allowed himself 0
to be led to 0
a side door in 0
the long row of 0
buildings of Scotland Yard 0
Almost before he knew 0
what he was doing 0
he had been passed 0
through the hands of 0
about four intermediate officials 0
and was suddenly shown 0
into a room the 0
abrupt blackness of which 0
startled him like a 0
It was not the 0
ordinary darkness in which 0
forms can be faintly 0
it was like going 0
Are you the new 0
asked a heavy voice 0
And in some strange 0
way though there was 0
not the shadow of 0
a shape in the 0
gloom Syme knew two 0
things first that it 0
came from a man 0
and second that the 0
man had his back 0
Are you the new 0
said the invisible chief 0
who seemed to have 0
heard all about it 0
Syme quite swept off 0
his feet made a 0
feeble fight against this 0
I really have no 0
No one has any 0
experience said the other 0
of the Battle of 0
But I am really 0
You are willing that 0
is enough said the 0
Well really said Syme 0
I don t know 0
any profession of which 0
mere willingness is the 0
I do said the 0
I am condemning you 0
Thus it was that 0
when Gabriel Syme came 0
out again into the 0
crimson light of evening 0
in his shabby black 0
hat and shabby lawless 0
cloak he came out 0
a member of the 0
New Detective Corps for 0
the frustration of the 0
Acting under the advice 0
of his friend the 0
who was professionally inclined 0
he trimmed his hair 0
and beard bought a 0
good hat clad himself 0
in an exquisite summer 0
suit of light blue 0
grey with a pale 0
yellow flower in the 0
button hole and in 0
short became that elegant 0
and rather insupportable person 0
whom Gregory had first 0
encountered in the little 0
garden of Saffron Park 0
Before he finally left 0
the police premises his 0
friend provided him with 0
a small blue card 0
on which was written 0
The Last Crusade and 0
a number the sign 0
of his official authority 0
He put this carefully 0
in his upper waistcoat 0
pocket lit a cigarette 0
and went forth to 0
track and fight the 0
enemy in all the 0
drawing rooms of London 0
Where his adventure ultimately 0
led him we have 0
At about half past 0
one on a February 0
night he found himself 0
steaming in a small 0
tug up the silent 0
Thames armed with swordstick 0
and revolver the duly 0
elected Thursday of the 0
Central Council of Anarchists 0
When Syme stepped out 0
on to the steam 0
tug he had a 0
singular sensation of stepping 0
out into something entirely 0
not merely into the 0
landscape of a new 0
land but even into 0
the landscape of a 0
This was mainly due 0
to the insane yet 0
solid decision of that 0
evening though partly also 0
to an entire change 0
in the weather and 0
the sky since he 0
entered the little tavern 0
some two hours before 0
Every trace of the 0
passionate plumage of the 0
cloudy sunset had been 0
swept away and a 0
naked moon stood in 0
The moon was so 0
strong and full that 0
by a paradox often 0
it seemed like a 0
It gave not the 0
sense of bright moonshine 0
but rather of a 0
Over the whole landscape 0
lay a luminous and 0
unnatural discoloration as of 0
that disastrous twilight which 0
Milton spoke of as 0
shed by the sun 0
so that Syme fell 0
easily into his first 0
thought that he was 0
actually on some other 0
and emptier planet which 0
circled round some sadder 0
But the more he 0
felt this glittering desolation 0
in the moonlit land 0
the more his own 0
chivalric folly glowed in 0
the night like a 0
Even the common things 0
he carried with him 0
the food and the 0
brandy and the loaded 0
pistol took on exactly 0
that concrete and material 0
poetry which a child 0
feels when he takes 0
a gun upon a 0
journey or a bun 0
with him to bed 0
The sword stick and 0
the brandy flask though 0
in themselves only the 0
tools of morbid conspirators 0
became the expressions of 0
his own more healthy 0
The sword stick became 0
almost the sword of 0
chivalry and the brandy 0
the wine of the 0
For even the most 0
dehumanised modern fantasies depend 0
on some older and 0
the adventures may be 0
mad but the adventurer 0
The dragon without St 0
George would not even 0
So this inhuman landscape 0
was only imaginative by 0
the presence of a 0
To Syme s exaggerative 0
mind the bright bleak 0
houses and terraces by 0
the Thames looked as 0
empty as the mountains 0
But even the moon 0
is only poetical because 0
there is a man 0
The tug was worked 0
by two men and 0
with much toil went 0
The clear moon that 0
had lit up Chiswick 0
had gone down by 0
the time that they 0
passed Battersea and when 0
they came under the 0
enormous bulk of Westminster 0
day had already begun 0
It broke like the 0
splitting of great bars 0
of lead showing bars 0
and these had brightened 0
like white fire when 0
the tug changing its 0
onward course turned inward 0
to a large landing 0
stage rather beyond Charing 0
The great stones of 0
the Embankment seemed equally 0
dark and gigantic as 0
Syme looked up at 0
They were big and 0
black against the huge 0
They made him feel 0
that he was landing 0
on the colossal steps 0
of some Egyptian palace 0
and indeed the thing 0
suited his mood for 0
he was in his 0
own mind mounting to 0
attack the solid thrones 0
of horrible and heathen 0
He leapt out of 0
the boat on to 0
one slimy step and 0
stood a dark and 0
slender figure amid the 0
The two men in 0
the tug put her 0
off again and turned 0
They had never spoken 0
CHAPTER V THE FEAST 0
AT first the large 0
stone stair seemed to 0
Syme as deserted as 0
but before he reached 0
the top he had 0
realised that there was 0
a man leaning over 0
the parapet of the 0
Embankment and looking out 0
As a figure he 0
was quite conventional clad 0
in a silk hat 0
and frock coat of 0
the more formal type 0
he had a red 0
flower in his buttonhole 0
As Syme drew nearer 0
to him step by 0
step he did not 0
even move a hair 0
and Syme could come 0
close enough to notice 0
even in the dim 0
pale morning light that 0
his face was long 0
pale and intellectual and 0
ended in a small 0
triangular tuft of dark 0
beard at the very 0
point of the chin 0
all else being clean 0
This scrap of hair 0
almost seemed a mere 0
the rest of the 0
face was of the 0
type that is best 0
shaven clear cut ascetic 0
and in its way 0
Syme drew closer and 0
closer noting all this 0
and still the figure 0
At first an instinct 0
had told Syme that 0
this was the man 0
whom he was meant 0
Then seeing that the 0
man made no sign 0
he had concluded that 0
And now again he 0
had come back to 0
a certainty that the 0
man had something to 0
do with his mad 0
For the man remained 0
more still than would 0
have been natural if 0
a stranger had come 0
He was as motionless 0
as a wax work 0
and got on the 0
nerves somewhat in the 0
Syme looked again and 0
again at the pale 0
dignified and delicate face 0
and the face still 0
looked blankly across the 0
Then he took out 0
of his pocket the 0
note from Buttons proving 0
his election and put 0
it before that sad 0
Then the man smiled 0
and his smile was 0
a shock for it 0
was all on one 0
side going up in 0
the right cheek and 0
down in the left 0
There was nothing rationally 0
speaking to scare anyone 0
Many people have this 0
nervous trick of a 0
crooked smile and in 0
many it is even 0
But in all Syme 0
s circumstances with the 0
dark dawn and the 0
deadly errand and the 0
loneliness on the great 0
dripping stones there was 0
something unnerving in it 0
There was the silent 0
river and the silent 0
man a man of 0
And there was the 0
last nightmare touch that 0
his smile suddenly went 0
The spasm of smile 0
was instantaneous and the 0
man s face dropped 0
at once into its 0
He spoke without further 0
explanation or inquiry like 0
a man speaking to 0
If we walk up 0
towards Leicester Square he 0
said we shall just 0
be in time for 0
Sunday always insists on 0
Have you had any 0
Nor have I answered 0
the man in an 0
I shall try to 0
get to bed after 0
He spoke with casual 0
civility but in an 0
utterly dead voice that 0
contradicted the fanaticism of 0
It seemed almost as 0
if all friendly words 0
were to him lifeless 0
conveniences and that his 0
only life was hate 0
After a pause the 0
Of course the Secretary 0
of the branch told 0
you everything that can 0
But the one thing 0
that can never be 0
told is the last 0
notion of the President 0
for his notions grow 0
like a tropical forest 0
So in case you 0
don t know I 0
d better tell you 0
that he is carrying 0
out his notion of 0
concealing ourselves by not 0
concealing ourselves to the 0
most extraordinary lengths just 0
Originally of course we 0
met in a cell 0
underground just as your 0
Then Sunday made us 0
take a private room 0
at an ordinary restaurant 0
He said that if 0
you didn t seem 0
to be hiding nobody 0
Well he is the 0
only man on earth 0
but sometimes I really 0
think that his huge 0
brain is going a 0
little mad in its 0
For now we flaunt 0
ourselves before the public 0
We have our breakfast 0
on a balcony on 0
a balcony if you 0
please overlooking Leicester Square 0
And what do the 0
It s quite simple 0
what they say answered 0
They say we are 0
a lot of jolly 0
gentlemen who pretend they 0
It seems to me 0
a very clever idea 0
God blast your impudence 0
cried out the other 0
in a sudden shrill 0
voice which was as 0
startling and discordant as 0
When you ve seen 0
Sunday for a split 0
second you ll leave 0
off calling him clever 0
With this they emerged 0
out of a narrow 0
street and saw the 0
early sunlight filling Leicester 0
It will never be 0
known I suppose why 0
this square itself should 0
look so alien and 0
in some ways so 0
It will never be 0
known whether it was 0
the foreign look that 0
attracted the foreigners or 0
the foreigners who gave 0
it the foreign look 0
But on this particular 0
morning the effect seemed 0
singularly bright and clear 0
Between the open square 0
and the sunlit leaves 0
and the statue and 0
the Saracenic outlines of 0
the Alhambra it looked 0
the replica of some 0
French or even Spanish 0
And this effect increased 0
in Syme the sensation 0
which in many shapes 0
he had had through 0
the whole adventure the 0
eerie sensation of having 0
strayed into a new 0
As a fact he 0
had bought bad cigars 0
round Leicester Square ever 0
since he was a 0
But as he turned 0
that corner and saw 0
the trees and the 0
Moorish cupolas he could 0
have sworn that he 0
was turning into an 0
unknown Place de something 0
or other in some 0
At one corner of 0
the square there projected 0
a kind of angle 0
of a prosperous but 0
quiet hotel the bulk 0
of which belonged to 0
In the wall there 0
was one large French 0
window probably the window 0
of a large coffee 0
and outside this window 0
almost literally overhanging the 0
square was a formidably 0
buttressed balcony big enough 0
to contain a dining 0
In fact it did 0
contain a dining table 0
or more strictly a 0
and round the breakfast 0
table glowing in the 0
sunlight and evident to 0
the street were a 0
group of noisy and 0
talkative men all dressed 0
in the insolence of 0
fashion with white waistcoats 0
and expensive button holes 0
Some of their jokes 0
could almost be heard 0
Then the grave Secretary 0
gave his unnatural smile 0
and Syme knew that 0
this boisterous breakfast party 0
was the secret conclave 0
of the European Dynamiters 0
Then as Syme continued 0
to stare at them 0
he saw something that 0
he had not seen 0
He had not seen 0
it literally because it 0
was too large to 0
At the nearest end 0
of the balcony blocking 0
up a great part 0
of the perspective was 0
the back of a 0
great mountain of a 0
When Syme had seen 0
him his first thought 0
was that the weight 0
of him must break 0
down the balcony of 0
His vastness did not 0
lie only in the 0
fact that he was 0
abnormally tall and quite 0
This man was planned 0
enormously in his original 0
proportions like a statue 0
carved deliberately as colossal 0
His head crowned with 0
white hair as seen 0
from behind looked bigger 0
than a head ought 0
The ears that stood 0
out from it looked 0
larger than human ears 0
He was enlarged terribly 0
and this sense of 0
size was so staggering 0
that when Syme saw 0
him all the other 0
figures seemed quite suddenly 0
to dwindle and become 0
They were still sitting 0
there as before with 0
their flowers and frock 0
coats but now it 0
looked as if the 0
big man was entertaining 0
five children to tea 0
As Syme and the 0
guide approached the side 0
door of the hotel 0
a waiter came out 0
smiling with every tooth 0
The gentlemen are up 0
there sare he said 0
They do talk and 0
they do laugh at 0
They do say they 0
will throw bombs at 0
And the waiter hurried 0
away with a napkin 0
over his arm much 0
pleased with the singular 0
frivolity of the gentlemen 0
The two men mounted 0
the stairs in silence 0
Syme had never thought 0
of asking whether the 0
monstrous man who almost 0
filled and broke the 0
balcony was the great 0
President of whom the 0
others stood in awe 0
He knew it was 0
so with an unaccountable 0
Syme indeed was one 0
of those men who 0
are open to all 0
the more nameless psychological 0
influences in a degree 0
a little dangerous to 0
Utterly devoid of fear 0
in physical dangers he 0
was a great deal 0
too sensitive to the 0
smell of spiritual evil 0
Twice already that night 0
little unmeaning things had 0
peeped out at him 0
almost pruriently and given 0
him a sense of 0
drawing nearer and nearer 0
to the head quarters 0
And this sense became 0
overpowering as he drew 0
nearer to the great 0
The form it took 0
was a childish and 0
As he walked across 0
the inner room towards 0
the balcony the large 0
face of Sunday grew 0
and Syme was gripped 0
with a fear that 0
when he was quite 0
close the face would 0
be too big to 0
be possible and that 0
he would scream aloud 0
He remembered that as 0
a child he would 0
not look at the 0
mask of Memnon in 0
the British Museum because 0
it was a face 0
By an effort braver 0
than that of leaping 0
over a cliff he 0
went to an empty 0
seat at the breakfast 0
table and sat down 0
The men greeted him 0
with good humoured raillery 0
as if they had 0
He sobered himself a 0
little by looking at 0
their conventional coats and 0
solid shining coffee pot 0
then he looked again 0
His face was very 0
large but it was 0
still possible to humanity 0
In the presence of 0
the President the whole 0
company looked sufficiently commonplace 0
nothing about them caught 0
the eye at first 0
except that by the 0
President s caprice they 0
had been dressed up 0
with a festive respectability 0
which gave the meal 0
the look of a 0
One man indeed stood 0
out at even a 0
He at least was 0
the common or garden 0
He wore indeed the 0
high white collar and 0
satin tie that were 0
the uniform of the 0
but out of this 0
collar there sprang a 0
head quite unmanageable and 0
quite unmistakable a bewildering 0
bush of brown hair 0
and beard that almost 0
obscured the eyes like 0
those of a Skye 0
But the eyes did 0
look out of the 0
tangle and they were 0
the sad eyes of 0
The effect of this 0
figure was not terrible 0
like that of the 0
President but it had 0
every diablerie that can 0
come from the utterly 0
If out of that 0
stiff tie and collar 0
there had come abruptly 0
the head of a 0
cat or a dog 0
it could not have 0
been a more idiotic 0
The man s name 0
it seemed was Gogol 0
he was a Pole 0
and in this circle 0
of days he was 0
His soul and speech 0
he could not force 0
himself to play the 0
prosperous and frivolous part 0
demanded of him by 0
And indeed when Syme 0
came in the President 0
with that daring disregard 0
of public suspicion which 0
was his policy was 0
actually chaffing Gogol upon 0
his inability to assume 0
Our friend Tuesday said 0
the President in a 0
deep voice at once 0
of quietude and volume 0
our friend Tuesday doesn 0
t seem to grasp 0
He dresses up like 0
a gentleman but he 0
seems to be too 0
great a soul to 0
He insists on the 0
ways of the stage 0
Now if a gentleman 0
goes about London in 0
a top hat and 0
a frock coat no 0
one need know that 0
he is an anarchist 0
But if a gentleman 0
puts on a top 0
hat and a frock 0
coat and then goes 0
about on his hands 0
and knees well he 0
That s what Brother 0
He goes about on 0
his hands and knees 0
with such inexhaustible diplomacy 0
that by this time 0
he finds it quite 0
difficult to walk upright 0
I am not good 0
at goncealment said Gogol 0
sulkily with a thick 0
I am not ashamed 0
Yes you are my 0
boy and so is 0
the cause of you 0
said the President good 0
You hide as much 0
but you can t 0
do it you see 0
you re such an 0
You try to combine 0
When a householder finds 0
a man under his 0
bed he will probably 0
pause to note the 0
But if he finds 0
a man under his 0
bed in a top 0
hat you will agree 0
with me my dear 0
Tuesday that he is 0
not likely even to 0
Now when you were 0
found under Admiral Biffin 0
I am not good 0
at deception said Tuesday 0
Right my boy right 0
said the President with 0
a ponderous heartiness you 0
aren t good at 0
While this stream of 0
conversation continued Syme was 0
looking more steadily at 0
the men around him 0
As he did so 0
he gradually felt all 0
his sense of something 0
He had thought at 0
first that they were 0
all of common stature 0
and costume with the 0
evident exception of the 0
But as he looked 0
at the others he 0
began to see in 0
each of them exactly 0
what he had seen 0
in the man by 0
the river a demoniac 0
That lop sided laugh 0
which would suddenly disfigure 0
the fine face of 0
his original guide was 0
typical of all these 0
Each man had something 0
about him perceived perhaps 0
at the tenth or 0
twentieth glance which was 0
not normal and which 0
The only metaphor he 0
could think of was 0
this that they all 0
looked as men of 0
fashion and presence would 0
look with the additional 0
twist given in a 0
false and curved mirror 0
Only the individual examples 0
will express this half 0
Syme s original cicerone 0
bore the title of 0
he was the Secretary 0
of the Council and 0
his twisted smile was 0
regarded with more terror 0
than anything except the 0
President s horrible happy 0
But now that Syme 0
had more space and 0
light to observe him 0
there were other touches 0
His fine face was 0
so emaciated that Syme 0
thought it must be 0
wasted with some disease 0
yet somehow the very 0
distress of his dark 0
It was no physical 0
ill that troubled him 0
His eyes were alive 0
with intellectual torture as 0
if pure thought was 0
He was typical of 0
each of the tribe 0
each man was subtly 0
Next to him sat 0
Tuesday the tousle headed 0
Gogol a man more 0
Next was Wednesday a 0
certain Marquis de St 0
Eustache a sufficiently characteristic 0
The first few glances 0
found nothing unusual about 0
him except that he 0
was the only man 0
at table who wore 0
the fashionable clothes as 0
if they were really 0
He had a black 0
French beard cut square 0
and a black English 0
frock coat cut even 0
But Syme sensitive to 0
such things felt somehow 0
that the man carried 0
a rich atmosphere with 0
him a rich atmosphere 0
It reminded one irrationally 0
of drowsy odours and 0
of dying lamps in 0
the darker poems of 0
With this went a 0
sense of his being 0
clad not in lighter 0
colours but in softer 0
his black seemed richer 0
and warmer than the 0
black shades about him 0
as if it were 0
compounded of profound colour 0
His black coat looked 0
as if it were 0
only black by being 0
too dense a purple 0
His black beard looked 0
as if it were 0
only black by being 0
too deep a blue 0
And in the gloom 0
and thickness of the 0
beard his dark red 0
mouth showed sensual and 0
Whatever he was he 0
was not a Frenchman 0
he might be a 0
he might be something 0
deeper yet in the 0
dark heart of the 0
In the bright coloured 0
Persian tiles and pictures 0
showing tyrants hunting you 0
may see just those 0
almond eyes those blue 0
black beards those cruel 0
Then came Syme and 0
next a very old 0
man Professor de Worms 0
who still kept the 0
chair of Friday though 0
every day it was 0
expected that his death 0
would leave it empty 0
Save for his intellect 0
he was in the 0
last dissolution of senile 0
His face was as 0
grey as his long 0
grey beard his forehead 0
was lifted and fixed 0
finally in a furrow 0
In no other case 0
not even that of 0
Gogol did the bridegroom 0
brilliancy of the morning 0
dress express a more 0
For the red flower 0
in his button hole 0
showed up against a 0
face that was literally 0
the whole hideous effect 0
was as if some 0
drunken dandies had put 0
their clothes upon a 0
When he rose or 0
sat down which was 0
with long labour and 0
peril something worse was 0
expressed than mere weakness 0
something indefinably connected with 0
the horror of the 0
It did not express 0
decrepitude merely but corruption 0
Another hateful fancy crossed 0
Syme s quivering mind 0
He could not help 0
thinking that whenever the 0
man moved a leg 0
or arm might fall 0
Right at the end 0
sat the man called 0
Saturday the simplest and 0
the most baffling of 0
He was a short 0
square man with a 0
dark square face clean 0
shaven a medical practitioner 0
going by the name 0
He had that combination 0
of savoir faire with 0
a sort of well 0
groomed coarseness which is 0
not uncommon in young 0
He carried his fine 0
clothes with confidence rather 0
than ease and he 0
mostly wore a set 0
There was nothing whatever 0
odd about him except 0
that he wore a 0
pair of dark almost 0
It may have been 0
merely a crescendo of 0
nervous fancy that had 0
gone before but those 0
black discs were dreadful 0
they reminded him of 0
half remembered ugly tales 0
of some story about 0
pennies being put on 0
the eyes of the 0
Syme s eye always 0
caught the black glasses 0
and the blind grin 0
Had the dying Professor 0
worn them or even 0
the pale Secretary they 0
would have been appropriate 0
But on the younger 0
and grosser man they 0
seemed only an enigma 0
They took away the 0
key of the face 0
You could not tell 0
what his smile or 0
Partly from this and 0
partly because he had 0
a vulgar virility wanting 0
in most of the 0
others it seemed to 0
Syme that he might 0
be the wickedest of 0
all those wicked men 0
Syme even had the 0
thought that his eyes 0
might be covered up 0
because they were too 0
CHAPTER VI THE EXPOSURE 0
SUCH were the six 0
men who had sworn 0
to destroy the world 0
Again and again Syme 0
strove to pull together 0
his common sense in 0
Sometimes he saw for 0
an instant that these 0
notions were subjective that 0
he was only looking 0
at ordinary men one 0
of whom was old 0
another nervous another short 0
The sense of an 0
unnatural symbolism always settled 0
back on him again 0
Each figure seemed to 0
be somehow on the 0
borderland of things just 0
as their theory was 0
on the borderland of 0
He knew that each 0
one of these men 0
stood at the extreme 0
end so to speak 0
of some wild road 0
He could only fancy 0
as in some old 0
world fable that if 0
a man went westward 0
to the end of 0
the world he would 0
find something say a 0
tree that was more 0
or less than a 0
tree a tree possessed 0
and that if he 0
went east to the 0
end of the world 0
he would find something 0
else that was not 0
wholly itself a tower 0
perhaps of which the 0
very shape was wicked 0
So these figures seemed 0
to stand up violent 0
and unaccountable against an 0
ultimate horizon visions from 0
The ends of the 0
earth were closing in 0
Talk had been going 0
on steadily as he 0
took in the scene 0
and not the least 0
of the contrasts of 0
that bewildering breakfast table 0
was the contrast between 0
the easy and unobtrusive 0
tone of talk and 0
They were deep in 0
the discussion of an 0
actual and immediate plot 0
The waiter downstairs had 0
spoken quite correctly when 0
he said that they 0
were talking about bombs 0
Only three days afterwards 0
the Czar was to 0
meet the President of 0
the French Republic in 0
Paris and over their 0
bacon and eggs upon 0
their sunny balcony these 0
beaming gentlemen had decided 0
how both should die 0
Even the instrument was 0
the black bearded Marquis 0
it appeared was to 0
Ordinarily speaking the proximity 0
of this positive and 0
objective crime would have 0
sobered Syme and cured 0
him of all his 0
He would have thought 0
of nothing but the 0
need of saving at 0
least two human bodies 0
from being ripped in 0
pieces with iron and 0
But the truth was 0
that by this time 0
he had begun to 0
feel a third kind 0
of fear more piercing 0
and practical than either 0
his moral revulsion or 0
Very simply he had 0
no fear to spare 0
for the French President 0
he had begun to 0
Most of the talkers 0
took little heed of 0
him debating now with 0
their faces closer together 0
and almost uniformly grave 0
save when for an 0
instant the smile of 0
the Secretary ran aslant 0
across his face as 0
the jagged lightning runs 0
aslant across the sky 0
But there was one 0
persistent thing which first 0
troubled Syme and at 0
The President was always 0
looking at him steadily 0
and with a great 0
The enormous man was 0
quite quiet but his 0
blue eyes stood out 0
And they were always 0
Syme felt moved to 0
spring up and leap 0
When the President s 0
eyes were on him 0
he felt as if 0
he were made of 0
He had hardly the 0
shred of a doubt 0
that in some silent 0
and extraordinary way Sunday 0
had found out that 0
he was a spy 0
He looked over the 0
edge of the balcony 0
and saw a policeman 0
standing abstractedly just beneath 0
staring at the bright 0
railings and the sunlit 0
Then there fell upon 0
him the great temptation 0
that was to torment 0
him for many days 0
In the presence of 0
these powerful and repulsive 0
men who were the 0
princes of anarchy he 0
had almost forgotten the 0
frail and fanciful figure 0
of the poet Gregory 0
the mere aesthete of 0
He even thought of 0
him now with an 0
old kindness as if 0
they had played together 0
But he remembered that 0
he was still tied 0
to Gregory by a 0
He had promised never 0
to do the very 0
thing that he now 0
felt himself almost in 0
the act of doing 0
He had promised not 0
to jump over that 0
balcony and speak to 0
He took his cold 0
hand off the cold 0
His soul swayed in 0
a vertigo of moral 0
He had only to 0
snap the thread of 0
a rash vow made 0
to a villainous society 0
and all his life 0
could be as open 0
and sunny as the 0
He had on the 0
other hand only to 0
keep his antiquated honour 0
and be delivered inch 0
by inch into the 0
power of this great 0
enemy of mankind whose 0
very intellect was a 0
Whenever he looked down 0
into the square he 0
saw the comfortable policeman 0
a pillar of common 0
sense and common order 0
Whenever he looked back 0
at the breakfast table 0
he saw the President 0
still quietly studying him 0
with big unbearable eyes 0
In all the torrent 0
of his thought there 0
were two thoughts that 0
never crossed his mind 0
First it never occurred 0
to him to doubt 0
that the President and 0
his Council could crush 0
him if he continued 0
The place might be 0
public the project might 0
But Sunday was not 0
the man who would 0
carry himself thus easily 0
without having somehow or 0
somewhere set open his 0
Either by anonymous poison 0
or sudden street accident 0
by hypnotism or by 0
fire from hell Sunday 0
could certainly strike him 0
If he defied the 0
man he was probably 0
dead either struck stiff 0
there in his chair 0
or long afterwards as 0
by an innocent ailment 0
If he called in 0
the police promptly arrested 0
everyone told all and 0
set against them the 0
whole energy of England 0
he would probably escape 0
They were a balconyful 0
of gentlemen overlooking a 0
bright and busy square 0
but he felt no 0
more safe with them 0
than if they had 0
been a boatful of 0
armed pirates overlooking an 0
There was a second 0
thought that never came 0
It never occurred to 0
him to be spiritually 0
won over to the 0
Many moderns inured to 0
a weak worship of 0
intellect and force might 0
have wavered in their 0
allegiance under this oppression 0
of a great personality 0
They might have called 0
Sunday the super man 0
If any such creature 0
be conceivable he looked 0
indeed somewhat like it 0
with his earth shaking 0
abstraction as of a 0
He might have been 0
called something above man 0
with his large plans 0
which were too obvious 0
to be detected with 0
his large face which 0
was too frank to 0
But this was a 0
kind of modern meanness 0
to which Syme could 0
not sink even in 0
Like any man he 0
was coward enough to 0
but he was not 0
quite coward enough to 0
The men were eating 0
as they talked and 0
even in this they 0
Bull and the Marquis 0
ate casually and conventionally 0
of the best things 0
on the table cold 0
pheasant or Strasbourg pie 0
But the Secretary was 0
a vegetarian and he 0
spoke earnestly of the 0
projected murder over half 0
a raw tomato and 0
three quarters of a 0
glass of tepid water 0
The old Professor had 0
such slops as suggested 0
a sickening second childhood 0
And even in this 0
President Sunday preserved his 0
curious predominance of mere 0
For he ate like 0
he ate incredibly with 0
a frightful freshness of 0
appetite so that it 0
was like watching a 0
Yet continually when he 0
had swallowed a dozen 0
crumpets or drunk a 0
quart of coffee he 0
would be found with 0
his great head on 0
one side staring at 0
I have often wondered 0
said the Marquis taking 0
a great bite out 0
of a slice of 0
bread and jam whether 0
it wouldn t be 0
better for me to 0
do it with a 0
Most of the best 0
things have been brought 0
off with a knife 0
And it would be 0
a new emotion to 0
get a knife into 0
a French President and 0
You are wrong said 0
the Secretary drawing his 0
The knife was merely 0
the expression of the 0
old personal quarrel with 0
Dynamite is not only 0
our best tool but 0
It is as perfect 0
a symbol of us 0
as is incense of 0
the prayers of the 0
it only destroys because 0
even so thought only 0
destroys because it broadens 0
A man s brain 0
is a bomb he 0
cried out loosening suddenly 0
his strange passion and 0
striking his own skull 0
My brain feels like 0
a bomb night and 0
A man s brain 0
must expand if it 0
breaks up the universe 0
I don t want 0
the universe broken up 0
just yet drawled the 0
I want to do 0
a lot of beastly 0
things before I die 0
I thought of one 0
No if the only 0
end of the thing 0
is nothing said Dr 0
Bull with his sphinx 0
like smile it hardly 0
The old Professor was 0
staring at the ceiling 0
Every man knows in 0
his heart he said 0
that nothing is worth 0
There was a singular 0
silence and then the 0
We are wandering however 0
The only question is 0
how Wednesday is to 0
I take it we 0
should all agree with 0
the original notion of 0
As to the actual 0
arrangements I should suggest 0
that tomorrow morning he 0
should go first of 0
The speech was broken 0
off short under a 0
President Sunday had risen 0
to his feet seeming 0
to fill the sky 0
Before we discuss that 0
he said in a 0
small quiet voice let 0
us go into a 0
I have something vent 0
Syme stood up before 0
any of the others 0
The instant of choice 0
had come at last 0
the pistol was at 0
On the pavement before 0
he could hear the 0
policeman idly stir and 0
stamp for the morning 0
though bright was cold 0
A barrel organ in 0
the street suddenly sprang 0
with a jerk into 0
Syme stood up taut 0
as if it had 0
been a bugle before 0
He found himself filled 0
with a supernatural courage 0
that came from nowhere 0
That jingling music seemed 0
full of the vivacity 0
the vulgarity and the 0
irrational valour of the 0
poor who in all 0
those unclean streets were 0
all clinging to the 0
decencies and the charities 0
His youthful prank of 0
being a policeman had 0
faded from his mind 0
he did not think 0
of himself as the 0
representative of the corps 0
of gentlemen turned into 0
fancy constables or of 0
the old eccentric who 0
lived in the dark 0
But he did feel 0
himself as the ambassador 0
of all these common 0
and kindly people in 0
the street who every 0
day marched into battle 0
to the music of 0
And this high pride 0
in being human had 0
lifted him unaccountably to 0
an infinite height above 0
the monstrous men around 0
For an instant at 0
least he looked down 0
upon all their sprawling 0
eccentricities from the starry 0
pinnacle of the commonplace 0
He felt towards them 0
all that unconscious and 0
elementary superiority that a 0
brave man feels over 0
powerful beasts or a 0
wise man over powerful 0
He knew that he 0
had neither the intellectual 0
nor the physical strength 0
but in that moment 0
he minded it no 0
more than the fact 0
that he had not 0
the muscles of a 0
tiger or a horn 0
on his nose like 0
All was swallowed up 0
in an ultimate certainty 0
that the President was 0
wrong and that the 0
barrel organ was right 0
There clanged in his 0
mind that unanswerable and 0
terrible truism in the 0
Pagens ont tort et 0
which in the old 0
nasal French has the 0
clang and groan of 0
This liberation of his 0
spirit from the load 0
of his weakness went 0
with a quite clear 0
decision to embrace death 0
If the people of 0
the barrel organ could 0
keep their old world 0
obligations so could he 0
This very pride in 0
keeping his word was 0
that he was keeping 0
It was his last 0
triumph over these lunatics 0
to go down into 0
their dark room and 0
die for something that 0
they could not even 0
The barrel organ seemed 0
to give the marching 0
tune with the energy 0
and the mingled noises 0
of a whole orchestra 0
and he could hear 0
deep and rolling under 0
all the trumpets of 0
the pride of life 0
the drums of the 0
The conspirators were already 0
filing through the open 0
window and into the 0
Syme went last outwardly 0
calm but with all 0
his brain and body 0
throbbing with romantic rhythm 0
The President led them 0
down an irregular side 0
stair such as might 0
be used by servants 0
and into a dim 0
cold empty room with 0
a table and benches 0
like an abandoned boardroom 0
When they were all 0
in he closed and 0
The first to speak 0
was Gogol the irreconcilable 0
who seemed bursting with 0
he cried with an 0
obscure excitement his heavy 0
Polish accent becoming almost 0
You zay you nod 0
You zay you show 0
It is all nuzzinks 0
Ven you vant talk 0
importance you run yourselves 0
in a dark box 0
The President seemed to 0
take the foreigner s 0
incoherent satire with entire 0
You can t get 0
hold of it yet 0
Gogol he said in 0
When once they have 0
heard us talking nonsense 0
on that balcony they 0
will not care where 0
If we had come 0
here first we should 0
have had the whole 0
staff at the keyhole 0
You don t seem 0
to know anything about 0
I die for zem 0
cried the Pole in 0
thick excitement and I 0
I care not for 0
these games of gonzealment 0
I would zmite ze 0
tyrant in ze open 0
I see I see 0
said the President nodding 0
kindly as he seated 0
himself at the top 0
of a long table 0
You die for mankind 0
first and then you 0
get up and smite 0
So that s all 0
And now may I 0
ask you to control 0
your beautiful sentiments and 0
sit down with the 0
other gentlemen at this 0
For the first time 0
this morning something intelligent 0
is going to be 0
Syme with the perturbed 0
promptitude he had shown 0
since the original summons 0
Gogol sat down last 0
grumbling in his brown 0
No one except Syme 0
seemed to have any 0
notion of the blow 0
that was about to 0
As for him he 0
had merely the feeling 0
of a man mounting 0
the scaffold with the 0
intention at any rate 0
of making a good 0
Comrades said the President 0
suddenly rising we have 0
spun out this farce 0
I have called you 0
down here to tell 0
you something so simple 0
and shocking that even 0
long inured to our 0
might hear some new 0
seriousness in my voice 0
Comrades we were discussing 0
plans and naming places 0
I propose before saying 0
anything else that those 0
plans and places should 0
not be voted by 0
this meeting but should 0
be left wholly in 0
the control of some 0
I suggest Comrade Saturday 0
They all stared at 0
then they all started 0
in their seats for 0
the next words though 0
not loud had a 0
living and sensational emphasis 0
Sunday struck the table 0
Not one word more 0
about the plans and 0
places must be said 0
Not one tiny detail 0
more about what we 0
mean to do must 0
be mentioned in this 0
Sunday had spent his 0
life in astonishing his 0
but it seemed as 0
if he had never 0
really astonished them until 0
They all moved feverishly 0
in their seats except 0
He sat stiff in 0
his with his hand 0
in his pocket and 0
on the handle of 0
When the attack on 0
him came he would 0
sell his life dear 0
He would find out 0
at least if the 0
Sunday went on smoothly 0
You will probably understand 0
that there is only 0
one possible motive for 0
forbidding free speech at 0
this festival of freedom 0
Strangers overhearing us matters 0
They assume that we 0
But what would matter 0
even unto death is 0
this that there should 0
be one actually among 0
us who is not 0
of us who knows 0
our grave purpose but 0
does not share it 0
The Secretary screamed out 0
suddenly like a woman 0
It can t be 0
The President flapped his 0
large flat hand on 0
the table like the 0
fin of some huge 0
Yes he said slowly 0
there is a spy 0
There is a traitor 0
I will waste no 0
Syme half rose from 0
his seat his finger 0
firm on the trigger 0
His name is Gogol 0
He is that hairy 0
humbug over there who 0
pretends to be a 0
Gogol sprang to his 0
feet a pistol in 0
With the same flash 0
three men sprang at 0
Even the Professor made 0
an effort to rise 0
But Syme saw little 0
of the scene for 0
he was blinded with 0
he had sunk down 0
into his seat shuddering 0
in a palsy of 0
CHAPTER VII THE UNACCOUNTABLE 0
CONDUCT OF PROFESSOR DE 0
said Sunday in a 0
voice that he used 0
once or twice in 0
his life a voice 0
that made men drop 0
The three who had 0
risen fell away from 0
Gogol and that equivocal 0
person himself resumed his 0
Well my man said 0
the President briskly addressing 0
him as one addresses 0
a total stranger will 0
you oblige me by 0
putting your hand in 0
your upper waistcoat pocket 0
and showing me what 0
The alleged Pole was 0
a little pale under 0
his tangle of dark 0
hair but he put 0
two fingers into the 0
pocket with apparent coolness 0
and pulled out a 0
blue strip of card 0
When Syme saw it 0
lying on the table 0
he woke up again 0
to the world outside 0
For although the card 0
lay at the other 0
extreme of the table 0
and he could read 0
nothing of the inscription 0
on it it bore 0
a startling resemblance to 0
the blue card in 0
his own pocket the 0
card which had been 0
given to him when 0
he joined the anti 0
Pathetic Slav said the 0
President tragic child of 0
Poland are you prepared 0
in the presence of 0
that card to deny 0
that you are in 0
this company shall we 0
said the late Gogol 0
It made everyone jump 0
to hear a clear 0
commercial and somewhat cockney 0
voice coming out of 0
that forest of foreign 0
It was irrational as 0
if a Chinaman had 0
suddenly spoken with a 0
I gather that you 0
fully understand your position 0
You bet answered the 0
I see it s 0
All I say is 0
I don t believe 0
any Pole could have 0
imitated my accent like 0
I concede the point 0
I believe your own 0
accent to be inimitable 0
though I shall practise 0
it in my bath 0
Do you mind leaving 0
your beard with your 0
Not a bit answered 0
and with one finger 0
he ripped off the 0
whole of his shaggy 0
head covering emerging with 0
thin red hair and 0
a pale pert face 0
It was hot he 0
I will do you 0
the justice to say 0
said Sunday not without 0
a sort of brutal 0
admiration that you seem 0
to have kept pretty 0
Now listen to me 0
The consequence is that 0
it would annoy me 0
for just about two 0
and a half minutes 0
if I heard that 0
you had died in 0
Well if you ever 0
tell the police or 0
any human soul about 0
us I shall have 0
that two and a 0
half minutes of discomfort 0
On your discomfort I 0
The red haired detective 0
who had masqueraded as 0
Gogol rose to his 0
feet without a word 0
and walked out of 0
the room with an 0
air of perfect nonchalance 0
Yet the astonished Syme 0
was able to realise 0
that this ease was 0
for there was a 0
slight stumble outside the 0
door which showed that 0
the departing detective had 0
not minded the step 0
Time is flying said 0
the President in his 0
gayest manner after glancing 0
at his watch which 0
like everything about him 0
seemed bigger than it 0
I must go off 0
I have to take 0
the chair at a 0
The Secretary turned to 0
him with working eyebrows 0
Would it not be 0
better he said a 0
little sharply to discuss 0
further the details of 0
our project now that 0
the spy has left 0
No I think not 0
said the President with 0
a yawn like an 0
Leave it as it 0
Let Saturday settle it 0
I must be off 0
Breakfast here next Sunday 0
But the late loud 0
scenes had whipped up 0
the almost naked nerves 0
He was one of 0
those men who are 0
conscientious even in crime 0
I must protest President 0
that the thing is 0
It is a fundamental 0
rule of our society 0
that all plans shall 0
be debated in full 0
Of course I fully 0
appreciate your forethought when 0
in the actual presence 0
Secretary said the President 0
seriously if you d 0
take your head home 0
and boil it for 0
a turnip it might 0
I can t say 0
The Secretary reared back 0
in a kind of 0
I really fail to 0
understand he began in 0
That s it that 0
s it said the 0
President nodding a great 0
That s where you 0
You fail to understand 0
Why you dancing donkey 0
he roared rising you 0
didn t want to 0
be overheard by a 0
spy didn t you 0
How do you know 0
you aren t overheard 0
And with these words 0
he shouldered his way 0
out of the room 0
shaking with incomprehensible scorn 0
Four of the men 0
left behind gaped after 0
him without any apparent 0
glimmering of his meaning 0
Syme alone had even 0
a glimmering and such 0
as it was it 0
froze him to the 0
If the last words 0
of the President meant 0
anything they meant that 0
he had not after 0
They meant that while 0
Sunday could not denounce 0
him like Gogol he 0
still could not trust 0
him like the others 0
The other four got 0
to their feet grumbling 0
more or less and 0
betook themselves elsewhere to 0
find lunch for it 0
was already well past 0
The Professor went last 0
very slowly and painfully 0
Syme sat long after 0
the rest had gone 0
revolving his strange position 0
He had escaped a 0
thunderbolt but he was 0
still under a cloud 0
At last he rose 0
and made his way 0
out of the hotel 0
The bright cold day 0
had grown increasingly colder 0
and when he came 0
out into the street 0
he was surprised by 0
a few flakes of 0
While he still carried 0
the sword stick and 0
the rest of Gregory 0
s portable luggage he 0
had thrown the cloak 0
down and left it 0
somewhere perhaps on the 0
steam tug perhaps on 0
Hoping therefore that the 0
snow shower might be 0
slight he stepped back 0
out of the street 0
for a moment and 0
stood up under the 0
doorway of a small 0
and greasy hair dresser 0
s shop the front 0
window of which was 0
empty except for a 0
sickly wax lady in 0
Snow however began to 0
thicken and fall fast 0
and Syme having found 0
one glance at the 0
wax lady quite sufficient 0
to depress his spirits 0
stared out instead into 0
the white and empty 0
He was considerably astonished 0
to see standing quite 0
still outside the shop 0
and staring into the 0
His top hat was 0
loaded with snow like 0
the hat of Father 0
Christmas the white drift 0
was rising round his 0
but it seemed as 0
if nothing could tear 0
him away from the 0
contemplation of the colourless 0
wax doll in dirty 0
That any human being 0
should stand in such 0
weather looking into such 0
a shop was a 0
matter of sufficient wonder 0
but his idle wonder 0
turned suddenly into a 0
for he realised that 0
the man standing there 0
was the paralytic old 0
It scarcely seemed the 0
place for a person 0
of his years and 0
Syme was ready to 0
believe anything about the 0
perversions of this dehumanized 0
but even he could 0
not believe that the 0
Professor had fallen in 0
love with that particular 0
He could only suppose 0
that the man s 0
involved some momentary fits 0
of rigidity or trance 0
He was not inclined 0
however to feel in 0
this case any very 0
On the contrary he 0
rather congratulated himself that 0
the Professor s stroke 0
and his elaborate and 0
limping walk would make 0
it easy to escape 0
from him and leave 0
For Syme thirsted first 0
and last to get 0
clear of the whole 0
poisonous atmosphere if only 0
Then he could collect 0
his thoughts formulate his 0
policy and decide finally 0
whether he should or 0
should not keep faith 0
He strolled away through 0
the dancing snow turned 0
up two or three 0
streets down through two 0
or three others and 0
entered a small Soho 0
He partook reflectively of 0
four small and quaint 0
courses drank half a 0
bottle of red wine 0
and ended up over 0
black coffee and a 0
black cigar still thinking 0
He had taken his 0
seat in the upper 0
room of the restaurant 0
which was full of 0
the chink of knives 0
and the chatter of 0
He remembered that in 0
old days he had 0
imagined that all these 0
harmless and kindly aliens 0
He shuddered remembering the 0
But even the shudder 0
had the delightful shame 0
The wine the common 0
food the familiar place 0
the faces of natural 0
and talkative men made 0
him almost feel as 0
if the Council of 0
the Seven Days had 0
been a bad dream 0
and although he knew 0
it was nevertheless an 0
objective reality it was 0
at least a distant 0
Tall houses and populous 0
streets lay between him 0
and his last sight 0
of the shameful seven 0
he was free in 0
free London and drinking 0
wine among the free 0
With a somewhat easier 0
action he took his 0
hat and stick and 0
strolled down the stair 0
into the shop below 0
When he entered that 0
lower room he stood 0
stricken and rooted to 0
At a small table 0
close up to the 0
blank window and the 0
white street of snow 0
sat the old anarchist 0
Professor over a glass 0
of milk with his 0
lifted livid face and 0
For an instant Syme 0
stood as rigid as 0
the stick he leant 0
Then with a gesture 0
as of blind hurry 0
he brushed past the 0
Professor dashing open the 0
door and slamming it 0
behind him and stood 0
outside in the snow 0
Can that old corpse 0
he asked himself biting 0
I stopped too long 0
up in that room 0
so that even such 0
leaden feet could catch 0
One comfort is with 0
a little brisk walking 0
I can put a 0
man like that as 0
far away as Timbuctoo 0
Or am I too 0
Was he really following 0
Surely Sunday would not 0
be such a fool 0
as to send a 0
He set off at 0
a smart pace twisting 0
and whirling his stick 0
in the direction of 0
As he crossed the 0
great market the snow 0
increased growing blinding and 0
bewildering as the afternoon 0
The snow flakes tormented 0
him like a swarm 0
Getting into his eyes 0
and beard they added 0
their unremitting futility to 0
his already irritated nerves 0
and by the time 0
that he had come 0
at a swinging pace 0
to the beginning of 0
Fleet Street he lost 0
patience and finding a 0
Sunday teashop turned into 0
it to take shelter 0
He ordered another cup 0
of black coffee as 0
Scarcely had he done 0
so when Professor de 0
Worms hobbled heavily into 0
the shop sat down 0
with difficulty and ordered 0
a glass of milk 0
Syme s walking stick 0
had fallen from his 0
hand with a great 0
clang which confessed the 0
But the Professor did 0
Syme who was commonly 0
a cool character was 0
literally gaping as a 0
rustic gapes at a 0
He had seen no 0
he had heard no 0
wheels outside the shop 0
to all mortal appearances 0
the man had come 0
But the old man 0
could only walk like 0
a snail and Syme 0
had walked like the 0
He started up and 0
snatched his stick half 0
crazy with the contradiction 0
in mere arithmetic and 0
swung out of the 0
swinging doors leaving his 0
An omnibus going to 0
the Bank went rattling 0
by with an unusual 0
He had a violent 0
run of a hundred 0
yards to reach it 0
but he managed to 0
spring swaying upon the 0
splash board and pausing 0
for an instant to 0
pant he climbed on 0
When he had been 0
seated for about half 0
a minute he heard 0
behind him a sort 0
of heavy and asthmatic 0
Turning sharply he saw 0
rising gradually higher and 0
higher up the omnibus 0
steps a top hat 0
soiled and dripping with 0
snow and under the 0
shadow of its brim 0
the short sighted face 0
and shaky shoulders of 0
He let himself into 0
a seat with characteristic 0
care and wrapped himself 0
up to the chin 0
in the mackintosh rug 0
Every movement of the 0
old man s tottering 0
figure and vague hands 0
every uncertain gesture and 0
panic stricken pause seemed 0
to put it beyond 0
question that he was 0
helpless that he was 0
in the last imbecility 0
He moved by inches 0
he let himself down 0
with little gasps of 0
And yet unless the 0
philosophical entities called time 0
and space have no 0
vestige even of a 0
practical existence it appeared 0
quite unquestionable that he 0
had run after the 0
Syme sprang erect upon 0
the rocking car and 0
after staring wildly at 0
the wintry sky that 0
grew gloomier every moment 0
he ran down the 0
He had repressed an 0
elemental impulse to leap 0
Too bewildered to look 0
back or to reason 0
he rushed into one 0
of the little courts 0
at the side of 0
Fleet Street as a 0
rabbit rushes into a 0
He had a vague 0
idea if this incomprehensible 0
old Jack in the 0
box was really pursuing 0
him that in that 0
labyrinth of little streets 0
he could soon throw 0
him off the scent 0
He dived in and 0
out of those crooked 0
lanes which were more 0
like cracks than thoroughfares 0
and by the time 0
that he had completed 0
about twenty alternate angles 0
and described an unthinkable 0
polygon he paused to 0
listen for any sound 0
there could not in 0
any case have been 0
much for the little 0
streets were thick with 0
Somewhere behind Red Lion 0
Court however he noticed 0
a place where some 0
energetic citizen had cleared 0
away the snow for 0
a space of about 0
twenty yards leaving the 0
wet glistening cobble stones 0
He thought little of 0
this as he passed 0
it only plunging into 0
yet another arm of 0
But when a few 0
hundred yards farther on 0
he stood still again 0
to listen his heart 0
stood still also for 0
he heard from that 0
space of rugged stones 0
the clinking crutch and 0
labouring feet of the 0
The sky above was 0
loaded with the clouds 0
of snow leaving London 0
in a darkness and 0
oppression premature for that 0
hour of the evening 0
On each side of 0
Syme the walls of 0
the alley were blind 0
there was no little 0
window or any kind 0
He felt a new 0
impulse to break out 0
of this hive of 0
houses and to get 0
once more into the 0
open and lamp lit 0
Yet he rambled and 0
dodged for a long 0
time before he struck 0
When he did so 0
he struck it much 0
farther up than he 0
He came out into 0
what seemed the vast 0
and void of Ludgate 0
Circus and saw St 0
Paul s Cathedral sitting 0
At first he was 0
startled to find these 0
great roads so empty 0
as if a pestilence 0
had swept through the 0
Then he told himself 0
that some degree of 0
first because the snow 0
storm was even dangerously 0
deep and secondly because 0
And at the very 0
word Sunday he bit 0
the word was henceforth 0
for hire like some 0
Under the white fog 0
of snow high up 0
in the heaven the 0
whole atmosphere of the 0
city was turned to 0
a very queer kind 0
of green twilight as 0
of men under the 0
The sealed and sullen 0
sunset behind the dark 0
Paul s had in 0
it smoky and sinister 0
colours colours of sickly 0
green dead red or 0
decaying bronze that were 0
just bright enough to 0
emphasise the solid whiteness 0
But right up against 0
these dreary colours rose 0
the black bulk of 0
and upon the top 0
of the cathedral was 0
a random splash and 0
great stain of snow 0
still clinging as to 0
It had fallen accidentally 0
but just so fallen 0
as to half drape 0
the dome from its 0
very topmost point and 0
to pick out in 0
perfect silver the great 0
orb and the cross 0
When Syme saw it 0
he suddenly straightened himself 0
and made with his 0
sword stick an involuntary 0
He knew that that 0
evil figure his shadow 0
was creeping quickly or 0
slowly behind him and 0
he did not care 0
It seemed a symbol 0
of human faith and 0
valour that while the 0
skies were darkening that 0
high place of the 0
The devils might have 0
captured heaven but they 0
had not yet captured 0
He had a new 0
impulse to tear out 0
the secret of this 0
dancing jumping and pursuing 0
and at the entrance 0
of the court as 0
it opened upon the 0
Circus he turned stick 0
in hand to face 0
Professor de Worms came 0
slowly round the corner 0
of the irregular alley 0
behind him his unnatural 0
form outlined against a 0
lonely gas lamp irresistibly 0
recalling that very imaginative 0
figure in the nursery 0
rhymes the crooked man 0
who went a crooked 0
He really looked as 0
if he had been 0
twisted out of shape 0
by the tortuous streets 0
he had been threading 0
He came nearer and 0
nearer the lamplight shining 0
on his lifted spectacles 0
his lifted patient face 0
Syme waited for him 0
George waited for the 0
dragon as a man 0
waits for a final 0
explanation or for death 0
And the old Professor 0
came right up to 0
him and passed him 0
like a total stranger 0
without even a blink 0
of his mournful eyelids 0
There was something in 0
this silent and unexpected 0
innocence that left Syme 0
in a final fury 0
The man s colourless 0
face and manner seemed 0
to assert that the 0
whole following had been 0
Syme was galvanised with 0
an energy that was 0
something between bitterness and 0
a burst of boyish 0
He made a wild 0
gesture as if to 0
knock the old man 0
s hat off called 0
out something like Catch 0
me if you can 0
and went racing away 0
across the white open 0
Concealment was impossible now 0
and looking back over 0
his shoulder he could 0
see the black figure 0
of the old gentleman 0
coming after him with 0
long swinging strides like 0
a man winning a 0
But the head upon 0
that bounding body was 0
still pale grave and 0
professional like the head 0
of a lecturer upon 0
the body of a 0
This outrageous chase sped 0
across Ludgate Circus up 0
Ludgate Hill round St 0
Paul s Cathedral along 0
Cheapside Syme remembering all 0
the nightmares he had 0
Then Syme broke away 0
towards the river and 0
ended almost down by 0
He saw the yellow 0
panes of a low 0
lighted public house flung 0
himself into it and 0
It was a foul 0
tavern sprinkled with foreign 0
sailors a place where 0
opium might be smoked 0
A moment later Professor 0
de Worms entered the 0
place sat down carefully 0
and asked for a 0
CHAPTER VIII THE PROFESSOR 0
WHEN Gabriel Syme found 0
himself finally established in 0
a chair and opposite 0
to him fixed and 0
final also the lifted 0
eyebrows and leaden eyelids 0
of the Professor his 0
This incomprehensible man from 0
the fierce council after 0
all had certainly pursued 0
If the man had 0
one character as a 0
paralytic and another character 0
as a pursuer the 0
antithesis might make him 0
more interesting but scarcely 0
It would be a 0
very small comfort that 0
he could not find 0
the Professor out if 0
by some serious accident 0
the Professor should find 0
He emptied a whole 0
pewter pot of ale 0
before the professor had 0
One possibility however kept 0
him hopeful and yet 0
It was just possible 0
that this escapade signified 0
something other than even 0
a slight suspicion of 0
Perhaps it was some 0
regular form or sign 0
Perhaps the foolish scamper 0
was some sort of 0
friendly signal that he 0
ought to have understood 0
Perhaps it was a 0
Perhaps the new Thursday 0
was always chased along 0
Cheapside as the new 0
Lord Mayor is always 0
He was just selecting 0
a tentative inquiry when 0
the old Professor opposite 0
suddenly and simply cut 0
Before Syme could ask 0
the first diplomatic question 0
the old anarchist had 0
asked suddenly without any 0
Are you a policeman 0
Whatever else Syme had 0
expected he had never 0
expected anything so brutal 0
and actual as this 0
Even his great presence 0
of mind could only 0
manage a reply with 0
an air of rather 0
he said laughing vaguely 0
Whatever made you think 0
of a policeman in 0
The process was simple 0
enough answered the Professor 0
I thought you looked 0
I think so now 0
Did I take a 0
policeman s hat by 0
mistake out of the 0
asked Syme smiling wildly 0
Have I by any 0
chance got a number 0
stuck on to me 0
Have my boots got 0
Why must I be 0
Do do let me 0
The old Professor shook 0
his head with a 0
gravity that gave no 0
hope but Syme ran 0
on with a feverish 0
But perhaps I misunderstood 0
the delicacies of your 0
Perhaps policeman is a 0
In an evolutionary sense 0
sir the ape fades 0
so gradually into the 0
policeman that I myself 0
can never detect the 0
The monkey is only 0
the policeman that may 0
Perhaps a maiden lady 0
on Clapham Common is 0
only the policeman that 0
I don t mind 0
being the policeman that 0
I don t mind 0
being anything in German 0
Are you in the 0
said the old man 0
ignoring all Syme s 0
improvised and desperate raillery 0
Are you a detective 0
Syme s heart turned 0
to stone but his 0
Your suggestion is ridiculous 0
The old man struck 0
his palsied hand passionately 0
on the rickety table 0
Did you hear me 0
ask a plain question 0
he shrieked in a 0
Are you or are 0
you not a police 0
answered Syme like a 0
man standing on the 0
You swear it said 0
the old man leaning 0
across to him his 0
dead face becoming as 0
it were loathsomely alive 0
If you swear falsely 0
will you be damned 0
Will you be sure 0
that the devil dances 0
Will you see that 0
the nightmare sits on 0
Will there really be 0
You are an anarchist 0
you are a dynamiter 0
Above all you are 0
not in any sense 0
You are not in 0
He leant his angular 0
elbow far across the 0
table and put up 0
his large loose hand 0
like a flap to 0
I am not in 0
the British police said 0
Syme with insane calm 0
Professor de Worms fell 0
back in his chair 0
with a curious air 0
That s a pity 0
he said because I 0
Syme sprang up straight 0
sending back the bench 0
behind him with a 0
Because you are what 0
I am a policeman 0
said the Professor with 0
his first broad smile 0
and beaming through his 0
But as you think 0
policeman only a relative 0
term of course I 0
have nothing to do 0
I am in the 0
but as you tell 0
me you are not 0
in the British police 0
force I can only 0
say that I met 0
you in a dynamiters 0
I suppose I ought 0
And with these words 0
he laid on the 0
table before Syme an 0
exact facsimile of the 0
blue card which Syme 0
had in his own 0
waistcoat pocket the symbol 0
of his power from 0
Syme had for a 0
flash the sensation that 0
the cosmos had turned 0
exactly upside down that 0
all trees were growing 0
downwards and that all 0
stars were under his 0
Then came slowly the 0
For the last twenty 0
four hours the cosmos 0
had really been upside 0
down but now the 0
capsized universe had come 0
right side up again 0
This devil from whom 0
he had been fleeing 0
all day was only 0
an elder brother of 0
his own house who 0
on the other side 0
of the table lay 0
back and laughed at 0
He did not for 0
the moment ask any 0
he only knew the 0
happy and silly fact 0
that this shadow which 0
had pursued him with 0
an intolerable oppression of 0
peril was only the 0
shadow of a friend 0
trying to catch him 0
He knew simultaneously that 0
he was a fool 0
and a free man 0
For with any recovery 0
from morbidity there must 0
go a certain healthy 0
There comes a certain 0
point in such conditions 0
when only three things 0
are possible first a 0
perpetuation of Satanic pride 0
secondly tears and third 0
Syme s egotism held 0
hard to the first 0
course for a few 0
seconds and then suddenly 0
Taking his own blue 0
police ticket from his 0
own waist coat pocket 0
he tossed it on 0
then he flung his 0
head back until his 0
spike of yellow beard 0
almost pointed at the 0
ceiling and shouted with 0
Even in that close 0
den perpetually filled with 0
the din of knives 0
plates cans clamorous voices 0
sudden struggles and stampedes 0
there was something Homeric 0
in Syme s mirth 0
which made many half 0
drunken men look round 0
What yer laughing at 0
asked one wondering labourer 0
At myself answered Syme 0
and went off again 0
into the agony of 0
Pull yourself together said 0
the Professor or you 0
Have some more beer 0
I ll join you 0
You haven t drunk 0
your milk said Syme 0
said the other in 0
tones of withering and 0
unfathomable contempt my milk 0
Do you think I 0
d look at the 0
beastly stuff when I 0
m out of sight 0
of the bloody anarchists 0
We re all Christians 0
in this room though 0
perhaps he added glancing 0
around at the reeling 0
crowd not strict ones 0
yes I ll finish 0
and he knocked the 0
tumbler off the table 0
making a crash of 0
glass and a splash 0
Syme was staring at 0
him with a happy 0
I understand now he 0
of course you re 0
not an old man 0
I can t take 0
my face off here 0
replied Professor de Worms 0
It s rather an 0
As to whether I 0
m an old man 0
that s not for 0
I was thirty eight 0
Yes but I mean 0
said Syme impatiently there 0
s nothing the matter 0
Yes answered the other 0
I am subject to 0
Syme s laughter at 0
all this had about 0
it a wild weakness 0
He laughed at the 0
idea of the paralytic 0
Professor being really a 0
young actor dressed up 0
as if for the 0
But he felt that 0
he would have laughed 0
as loudly if a 0
pepperpot had fallen over 0
The false Professor drank 0
and wiped his false 0
Did you know he 0
asked that that man 0
Gogol was one of 0
No I didn t 0
know it answered Syme 0
But didn t you 0
I knew no more 0
than the dead replied 0
the man who called 0
I thought the President 0
was talking about me 0
and I rattled in 0
And I thought he 0
was talking about me 0
said Syme with his 0
I had my hand 0
on my revolver all 0
So had I said 0
so had Gogol evidently 0
Syme struck the table 0
Why there were three 0
Three out of seven 0
is a fighting number 0
If we had only 0
known that we were 0
The face of Professor 0
de Worms darkened and 0
he did not look 0
We were three he 0
If we had been 0
three hundred we could 0
still have done nothing 0
Not if we were 0
three hundred against four 0
asked Syme jeering rather 0
No said the Professor 0
with sobriety not if 0
we were three hundred 0
And the mere name 0
struck Syme cold and 0
his laughter had died 0
in his heart before 0
it could die on 0
The face of the 0
unforgettable President sprang into 0
his mind as startling 0
as a coloured photograph 0
and he remarked this 0
difference between Sunday and 0
all his satellites that 0
their faces however fierce 0
or sinister became gradually 0
blurred by memory like 0
other human faces whereas 0
Sunday s seemed almost 0
to grow more actual 0
during absence as if 0
a man s painted 0
portrait should slowly come 0
They were both silent 0
for a measure of 0
moments and then Syme 0
s speech came with 0
a rush like the 0
sudden foaming of champagne 0
Professor he cried it 0
Are you afraid of 0
The Professor lifted his 0
heavy lids and gazed 0
at Syme with large 0
wide open blue eyes 0
of an almost ethereal 0
Yes I am he 0
Syme was dumb for 0
Then he rose to 0
his feet erect like 0
an insulted man and 0
thrust the chair away 0
Yes he said in 0
a voice indescribable you 0
I am afraid of 0
Therefore I swear by 0
God that I will 0
seek out this man 0
whom I fear until 0
I find him and 0
strike him on the 0
If heaven were his 0
throne and the earth 0
his footstool I swear 0
that I would pull 0
asked the staring Professor 0
Because I am afraid 0
of him said Syme 0
and no man should 0
leave in the universe 0
anything of which he 0
De Worms blinked at 0
him with a sort 0
He made an effort 0
to speak but Syme 0
went on in a 0
low voice but with 0
an undercurrent of inhuman 0
Who would condescend to 0
strike down the mere 0
things that he does 0
Who would debase himself 0
to be merely brave 0
like any common prizefighter 0
Who would stoop to 0
be fearless like a 0
Fight the thing that 0
You remember the old 0
tale of the English 0
clergyman who gave the 0
last rites to the 0
brigand of Sicily and 0
how on his death 0
bed the great robber 0
said I can give 0
you no money but 0
I can give you 0
advice for a lifetime 0
your thumb on the 0
blade and strike upwards 0
So I say to 0
you strike upwards if 0
you strike at the 0
The other looked at 0
the ceiling one of 0
the tricks of his 0
Sunday is a fixed 0
You shall see him 0
a falling star said 0
Syme and put on 0
The decision of his 0
gesture drew the Professor 0
vaguely to his feet 0
Have you any idea 0
he asked with a 0
sort of benevolent bewilderment 0
exactly where you are 0
Yes replied Syme shortly 0
I am going to 0
prevent this bomb being 0
Have you any conception 0
No said Syme with 0
You remember of course 0
resumed the soi disant 0
de Worms pulling his 0
beard and looking out 0
of the window that 0
when we broke up 0
rather hurriedly the whole 0
arrangements for the atrocity 0
were left in the 0
private hands of the 0
The Marquis is by 0
this time probably crossing 0
But where he will 0
go and what he 0
will do it is 0
doubtful whether even the 0
certainly we don t 0
The only man who 0
does know is Dr 0
And we don t 0
know where he is 0
Yes said the other 0
in his curious absent 0
minded way I know 0
where he is myself 0
Will you tell me 0
asked Syme with eager 0
I will take you 0
there said the Professor 0
and took down his 0
own hat from a 0
Syme stood looking at 0
him with a sort 0
What do you mean 0
Will you join me 0
Will you take the 0
Young man said the 0
Professor pleasantly I am 0
amused to observe that 0
you think I am 0
As to that I 0
will say only one 0
word and that shall 0
be entirely in the 0
manner of your own 0
You think that it 0
is possible to pull 0
I know that it 0
is impossible and I 0
am going to try 0
it and opening the 0
tavern door which let 0
in a blast of 0
bitter air they went 0
out together into the 0
dark streets by the 0
Most of the snow 0
was melted or trampled 0
to mud but here 0
and there a clot 0
of it still showed 0
grey rather than white 0
The small streets were 0
sloppy and full of 0
pools which reflected the 0
flaming lamps irregularly and 0
by accident like fragments 0
of some other and 0
Syme felt almost dazed 0
as he stepped through 0
this growing confusion of 0
but his companion walked 0
on with a certain 0
briskness towards where at 0
the end of the 0
street an inch or 0
two of the lamplit 0
river looked like a 0
Where are you going 0
Just now answered the 0
Professor I am going 0
just round the corner 0
to see whether Dr 0
Bull has gone to 0
He is hygienic and 0
Does he live round 0
No answered his friend 0
As a matter of 0
fact he lives some 0
way off on the 0
other side of the 0
river but we can 0
tell from here whether 0
he has gone to 0
Turning the corner as 0
he spoke and facing 0
the dim river flecked 0
with flame he pointed 0
with his stick to 0
On the Surrey side 0
at this point there 0
ran out into the 0
Thames seeming almost to 0
overhang it a bulk 0
and cluster of those 0
tall tenements dotted with 0
lighted windows and rising 0
like factory chimneys to 0
an almost insane height 0
Their special poise and 0
position made one block 0
of buildings especially look 0
like a Tower of 0
Babel with a hundred 0
Syme had never seen 0
any of the sky 0
scraping buildings in America 0
so he could only 0
think of the buildings 0
Even as he stared 0
the highest light in 0
this innumerably lighted turret 0
abruptly went out as 0
if this black Argus 0
had winked at him 0
with one of his 0
Professor de Worms swung 0
round on his heel 0
and struck his stick 0
We are too late 0
he said the hygienic 0
Doctor has gone to 0
What do you mean 0
Does he live over 0
Yes said de Worms 0
behind that particular window 0
which you can t 0
Come along and get 0
We must call on 0
Without further parley he 0
led the way through 0
several by ways until 0
they came out into 0
the flare and clamour 0
of the East India 0
The Professor who seemed 0
to know his way 0
about the neighbourhood proceeded 0
to a place where 0
the line of lighted 0
shops fell back into 0
a sort of abrupt 0
twilight and quiet in 0
which an old white 0
inn all out of 0
repair stood back some 0
twenty feet from the 0
You can find good 0
English inns left by 0
accident everywhere like fossils 0
I once found a 0
decent place in the 0
I suppose said Syme 0
smiling that this is 0
the corresponding decent place 0
in the East End 0
It is said the 0
Professor reverently and went 0
In that place they 0
dined and slept both 0
The beans and bacon 0
which these unaccountable people 0
cooked well the astonishing 0
emergence of Burgundy from 0
their cellars crowned Syme 0
s sense of a 0
new comradeship and comfort 0
Through all this ordeal 0
his root horror had 0
been isolation and there 0
are no words to 0
express the abyss between 0
isolation and having one 0
It may be conceded 0
to the mathematicians that 0
four is twice two 0
But two is not 0
two is two thousand 0
That is why in 0
spite of a hundred 0
disadvantages the world will 0
always return to monogamy 0
Syme was able to 0
pour out for the 0
first time the whole 0
of his outrageous tale 0
from the time when 0
Gregory had taken him 0
to the little tavern 0
He did it idly 0
and amply in a 0
luxuriant monologue as a 0
man speaks with very 0
On his side also 0
the man who had 0
impersonated Professor de Worms 0
was not less communicative 0
His own story was 0
almost as silly as 0
That s a good 0
get up of yours 0
said Syme draining a 0
a lot better than 0
Even at the start 0
I thought he was 0
a bit too hairy 0
A difference of artistic 0
theory replied the Professor 0
Gogol was an idealist 0
He made up as 0
the abstract or platonic 0
ideal of an anarchist 0
But I am a 0
I am a portrait 0
But indeed to say 0
that I am a 0
portrait painter is an 0
I am a portrait 0
I don t understand 0
I am a portrait 0
I am a portrait 0
of the celebrated Professor 0
de Worms who is 0
I believe in Naples 0
You mean you are 0
made up like him 0
But doesn t he 0
know that you are 0
taking his nose in 0
He knows it right 0
enough replied his friend 0
Then why doesn t 0
I have denounced him 0
Do explain yourself said 0
With pleasure if you 0
don t mind hearing 0
my story replied the 0
I am by profession 0
an actor and my 0
When I was on 0
the stage I mixed 0
with all sorts of 0
Bohemian and blackguard company 0
Sometimes I touched the 0
edge of the turf 0
sometimes the riff raff 0
of the arts and 0
occasionally the political refugee 0
In some den of 0
exiled dreamers I was 0
introduced to the great 0
German Nihilist philosopher Professor 0
I did not gather 0
much about him beyond 0
his appearance which was 0
very disgusting and which 0
I understood that he 0
had proved that the 0
destructive principle in the 0
hence he insisted on 0
the need for a 0
furious and incessant energy 0
rending all things in 0
Energy he said was 0
He was lame shortsighted 0
When I met him 0
I was in a 0
frivolous mood and I 0
disliked him so much 0
that I resolved to 0
If I had been 0
a draughtsman I would 0
have drawn a caricature 0
I was only an 0
actor I could only 0
I made myself up 0
into what was meant 0
for a wild exaggeration 0
of the old Professor 0
s dirty old self 0
When I went into 0
the room full of 0
his supporters I expected 0
to be received with 0
a roar of laughter 0
if they were too 0
with a roar of 0
indignation at the insult 0
I cannot describe the 0
surprise I felt when 0
my entrance was received 0
with a respectful silence 0
when I had first 0
with a murmur of 0
The curse of the 0
perfect artist had fallen 0
I had been too 0
subtle I had been 0
They thought I really 0
was the great Nihilist 0
I was a healthy 0
minded young man at 0
the time and I 0
confess that it was 0
Before I could fully 0
recover however two or 0
three of these admirers 0
ran up to me 0
radiating indignation and told 0
me that a public 0
insult had been put 0
upon me in the 0
I inquired its nature 0
It seemed that an 0
impertinent fellow had dressed 0
himself up as a 0
preposterous parody of myself 0
I had drunk more 0
champagne than was good 0
for me and in 0
a flash of folly 0
I decided to see 0
Consequently it was to 0
meet the glare of 0
the company and my 0
own lifted eyebrows and 0
freezing eyes that the 0
real Professor came into 0
I need hardly say 0
there was a collision 0
The pessimists all round 0
me looked anxiously from 0
one Professor to the 0
other Professor to see 0
which was really the 0
An old man in 0
poor health like my 0
rival could not be 0
expected to be so 0
impressively feeble as a 0
young actor in the 0
You see he really 0
had paralysis and working 0
within this definite limitation 0
he couldn t be 0
so jolly paralytic as 0
Then he tried to 0
blast my claims intellectually 0
I countered that by 0
a very simple dodge 0
Whenever he said something 0
that nobody but he 0
could understand I replied 0
with something which I 0
could not even understand 0
I don t fancy 0
he said that you 0
could have worked out 0
the principle that evolution 0
is only negation since 0
there inheres in it 0
the introduction of lacuna 0
which are an essential 0
I replied quite scornfully 0
You read all that 0
the notion that involution 0
functioned eugenically was exposed 0
long ago by Glumpe 0
It is unnecessary for 0
me to say that 0
there never were such 0
people as Pinckwerts and 0
But the people all 0
rather to my surprise 0
seemed to remember them 0
quite well and the 0
Professor finding that the 0
learned and mysterious method 0
left him rather at 0
the mercy of an 0
enemy slightly deficient in 0
scruples fell back upon 0
a more popular form 0
I see he sneered 0
you prevail like the 0
false pig in Aesop 0
And you fail I 0
answered smiling like the 0
Need I say that 0
there is no hedgehog 0
Your claptrap comes off 0
so would your beard 0
I had no intelligent 0
answer to this which 0
was quite true and 0
But I laughed heartily 0
answered Like the Pantheist 0
s boots at random 0
and turned on my 0
heel with all the 0
The real Professor was 0
thrown out but not 0
with violence though one 0
man tried very patiently 0
to pull off his 0
He is now I 0
believe received everywhere in 0
Europe as a delightful 0
His apparent earnestness and 0
anger you see make 0
him all the more 0
Well said Syme I 0
can understand your putting 0
on his dirty old 0
beard for a night 0
s practical joke but 0
I don t understand 0
your never taking it 0
That is the rest 0
of the story said 0
When I myself left 0
the company followed by 0
reverent applause I went 0
limping down the dark 0
street hoping that I 0
should soon be far 0
enough away to be 0
able to walk like 0
To my astonishment as 0
I was turning the 0
corner I felt a 0
touch on the shoulder 0
and turning found myself 0
under the shadow of 0
He told me I 0
I struck a sort 0
of paralytic attitude and 0
cried in a high 0
German accent Yes I 0
am wanted by the 0
oppressed of the world 0
You are arresting me 0
on the charge of 0
being the great anarchist 0
The policeman impassively consulted 0
a paper in his 0
hand No sir he 0
said civilly at least 0
I am arresting you 0
on the charge of 0
not being the celebrated 0
anarchist Professor de Worms 0
This charge if it 0
was criminal at all 0
was certainly the lighter 0
of the two and 0
I went along with 0
the man doubtful but 0
I was shown into 0
a number of rooms 0
and eventually into the 0
presence of a police 0
officer who explained that 0
a serious campaign had 0
been opened against the 0
centres of anarchy and 0
that this my successful 0
masquerade might be of 0
considerable value to the 0
He offered me a 0
good salary and this 0
Though our conversation was 0
short he struck me 0
as a man of 0
very massive common sense 0
but I cannot tell 0
you much about him 0
Syme laid down his 0
I know he said 0
because you talked to 0
him in a dark 0
Professor de Worms nodded 0
and drained his glass 0
CHAPTER IX THE MAN 0
BURGUNDY is a jolly 0
thing said the Professor 0
sadly as he set 0
You don t look 0
as if it were 0
you drink it as 0
if it were medicine 0
You must excuse my 0
manner said the Professor 0
dismally my position is 0
rather a curious one 0
Inside I am really 0
bursting with boyish merriment 0
but I acted the 0
paralytic Professor so well 0
that now I can 0
So that when I 0
am among friends and 0
have no need at 0
all to disguise myself 0
I still can t 0
help speaking slow and 0
wrinkling my forehead just 0
as if it were 0
I can be quite 0
happy you understand but 0
only in a paralytic 0
The most buoyant exclamations 0
leap up in my 0
heart but they come 0
out of my mouth 0
You should hear me 0
say Buck up old 0
It would bring tears 0
It does said Syme 0
but I cannot help 0
thinking that apart from 0
all that you are 0
really a bit worried 0
The Professor started a 0
little and looked at 0
You are a very 0
clever fellow he said 0
it is a pleasure 0
to work with you 0
Yes I have rather 0
a heavy cloud in 0
There is a great 0
problem to face and 0
he sank his bald 0
brow in his two 0
Then he said in 0
Can you play the 0
Yes said Syme in 0
simple wonder I m 0
supposed to have a 0
Then as the other 0
did not speak he 0
I trust the great 0
After a long silence 0
the Professor said out 0
of the cavernous shadow 0
It would have done 0
just as well if 0
you could work a 0
Thank you said Syme 0
Listen to me said 0
the other and remember 0
whom we have to 0
You and I are 0
going tomorrow to attempt 0
something which is very 0
much more dangerous than 0
trying to steal the 0
Crown Jewels out of 0
We are trying to 0
steal a secret from 0
a very sharp very 0
strong and very wicked 0
I believe there is 0
no man except the 0
President of course who 0
is so seriously startling 0
and formidable as that 0
little grinning fellow in 0
He has not perhaps 0
the white hot enthusiasm 0
unto death the mad 0
martyrdom for anarchy which 0
But then that very 0
fanaticism in the Secretary 0
has a human pathos 0
and is almost a 0
But the little Doctor 0
has a brutal sanity 0
that is more shocking 0
than the Secretary s 0
Don t you notice 0
his detestable virility and 0
He bounces like an 0
Depend on it Sunday 0
I wonder if he 0
when he locked up 0
all the plans of 0
this outrage in the 0
round black head of 0
And you think said 0
Syme that this unique 0
monster will be soothed 0
if I play the 0
Don t be an 0
ass said his mentor 0
I mentioned the piano 0
because it gives one 0
quick and independent fingers 0
Syme if we are 0
to go through this 0
interview and come out 0
sane or alive we 0
must have some code 0
of signals between us 0
that this brute will 0
I have made a 0
rough alphabetical cypher corresponding 0
to the five fingers 0
like this see and 0
he rippled with his 0
fingers on the wooden 0
table B A D 0
bad a word we 0
Syme poured himself out 0
another glass of wine 0
and began to study 0
He was abnormally quick 0
with his brains at 0
puzzles and with his 0
hands at conjuring and 0
it did not take 0
him long to learn 0
how he might convey 0
simple messages by what 0
would seem to be 0
idle taps upon a 0
But wine and companionship 0
had always the effect 0
of inspiring him to 0
a farcical ingenuity and 0
the Professor soon found 0
himself struggling with the 0
too vast energy of 0
the new language as 0
it passed through the 0
heated brain of Syme 0
We must have several 0
word signs said Syme 0
seriously words that we 0
are likely to want 0
fine shades of meaning 0
My favourite word is 0
Do stop playing the 0
goat said the Professor 0
You don t know 0
how serious this is 0
Lush too said Syme 0
shaking his head sagaciously 0
we must have lush 0
word applied to grass 0
don t you know 0
Do you imagine asked 0
the Professor furiously that 0
we are going to 0
There are several ways 0
in which the subject 0
could be approached said 0
Syme reflectively and the 0
word introduced without appearing 0
We might say Dr 0
Bull as a revolutionist 0
you remember that a 0
tyrant once advised us 0
and indeed many of 0
us looking on the 0
fresh lush grass of 0
Do you understand said 0
the other that this 0
always be comic in 0
What the deuce else 0
I wish this language 0
of yours had a 0
I suppose we could 0
not extend it from 0
the fingers to the 0
That would involve pulling 0
off our boots and 0
socks during the conversation 0
which however unobtrusively performed 0
Syme said his friend 0
with a stern simplicity 0
Syme however sat up 0
in bed for a 0
considerable time mastering the 0
He was awakened next 0
morning while the east 0
was still sealed with 0
darkness and found his 0
grey bearded ally standing 0
like a ghost beside 0
Syme sat up in 0
then slowly collected his 0
thoughts threw off the 0
bed clothes and stood 0
It seemed to him 0
in some curious way 0
that all the safety 0
and sociability of the 0
night before fell with 0
the bedclothes off him 0
and he stood up 0
in an air of 0
He still felt an 0
entire trust and loyalty 0
but it was the 0
trust between two men 0
going to the scaffold 0
Well said Syme with 0
a forced cheerfulness as 0
he pulled on his 0
trousers I dreamt of 0
that alphabet of yours 0
Did it take you 0
long to make it 0
The Professor made no 0
answer but gazed in 0
front of him with 0
eyes the colour of 0
so Syme repeated his 0
I say did it 0
take you long to 0
I m considered good 0
at these things and 0
it was a good 0
Did you learn it 0
all on the spot 0
The Professor was silent 0
his eyes were wide 0
open and he wore 0
a fixed but very 0
How long did it 0
The Professor did not 0
Confound you can t 0
called out Syme in 0
a sudden anger that 0
had something like fear 0
Whether or no the 0
Professor could answer he 0
Syme stood staring back 0
at the stiff face 0
like parchment and the 0
His first thought was 0
that the Professor had 0
gone mad but his 0
second thought was more 0
After all what did 0
he know about this 0
queer creature whom he 0
had heedlessly accepted as 0
What did he know 0
except that the man 0
had been at the 0
anarchist breakfast and had 0
told him a ridiculous 0
How improbable it was 0
that there should be 0
another friend there beside 0
Was this man s 0
silence a sensational way 0
Was this adamantine stare 0
after all only the 0
awful sneer of some 0
threefold traitor who had 0
turned for the last 0
He stood and strained 0
his ears in this 0
He almost fancied he 0
could hear dynamiters come 0
to capture him shifting 0
softly in the corridor 0
Then his eye strayed 0
downwards and he burst 0
Though the Professor himself 0
stood there as voiceless 0
as a statue his 0
five dumb fingers were 0
dancing alive upon the 0
Syme watched the twinkling 0
movements of the talking 0
hand and read clearly 0
I will only talk 0
We must get used 0
He rapped out the 0
answer with the impatience 0
Let s get out 0
They took their hats 0
and sticks in silence 0
but as Syme took 0
his sword stick he 0
They paused for a 0
few minutes only to 0
stuff down coffee and 0
coarse thick sandwiches at 0
a coffee stall and 0
then made their way 0
across the river which 0
under the grey and 0
growing light looked as 0
They reached the bottom 0
of the huge block 0
of buildings which they 0
had seen from across 0
the river and began 0
in silence to mount 0
the naked and numberless 0
stone steps only pausing 0
now and then to 0
make short remarks on 0
the rail of the 0
At about every other 0
flight they passed a 0
each window showed them 0
a pale and tragic 0
dawn lifting itself laboriously 0
From each the innumerable 0
roofs of slate looked 0
like the leaden surges 0
of a grey troubled 0
Syme was increasingly conscious 0
that his new adventure 0
had somehow a quality 0
of cold sanity worse 0
than the wild adventures 0
Last night for instance 0
the tall tenements had 0
seemed to him like 0
a tower in a 0
As he now went 0
up the weary and 0
perpetual steps he was 0
daunted and bewildered by 0
their almost infinite series 0
But it was not 0
the hot horror of 0
a dream or of 0
anything that might be 0
Their infinity was more 0
like the empty infinity 0
of arithmetic something unthinkable 0
yet necessary to thought 0
Or it was like 0
the stunning statements of 0
astronomy about the distance 0
of the fixed stars 0
He was ascending the 0
house of reason a 0
thing more hideous than 0
By the time they 0
Bull s landing a 0
last window showed them 0
a harsh white dawn 0
edged with banks of 0
a kind of coarse 0
red more like red 0
clay than red cloud 0
And when they entered 0
Bull s bare garret 0
it was full of 0
Syme had been haunted 0
by a half historic 0
memory in connection with 0
these empty rooms and 0
The moment he saw 0
the garret and Dr 0
Bull sitting writing at 0
a table he remembered 0
what the memory was 0
There should have been 0
the black outline of 0
a guillotine against that 0
heavy red and white 0
Bull was in his 0
white shirt and black 0
his cropped dark head 0
might well have just 0
come out of its 0
he might have been 0
Marat or a more 0
Yet when he was 0
seen properly the French 0
The Jacobins were idealists 0
there was about this 0
man a murderous materialism 0
His Dosition gave him 0
a somewhat new appearance 0
The strong white light 0
of morning coming from 0
one side creating sharp 0
shadows made him seem 0
both more pale and 0
more angular than he 0
had looked at the 0
breakfast on the balcony 0
Thus the two black 0
glasses that encased his 0
eyes might really have 0
been black cavities in 0
his skull making him 0
look like a death 0
And indeed if ever 0
Death himself sat writing 0
at a wooden table 0
it might have been 0
He looked up and 0
smiled brightly enough as 0
the men came in 0
and rose with the 0
resilient rapidity of which 0
the Professor had spoken 0
He set chairs for 0
both of them and 0
going to a peg 0
behind the door proceeded 0
to put on a 0
coat and waistcoat of 0
he buttoned it up 0
neatly and came back 0
to sit down at 0
The quiet good humour 0
of his manner left 0
his two opponents helpless 0
It was with some 0
momentary difficulty that the 0
Professor broke silence and 0
began I m sorry 0
to disturb you so 0
early comrade said he 0
with a careful resumption 0
of the slow de 0
You have no doubt 0
made all the arrangements 0
for the Paris affair 0
Then he added with 0
infinite slowness We have 0
information which renders intolerable 0
anything in the nature 0
of a moment s 0
Bull smiled again but 0
continued to gaze on 0
The Professor resumed a 0
pause before each weary 0
Please do not think 0
but I advise you 0
to alter those plans 0
or if it is 0
too late for that 0
to follow your agent 0
with all the support 0
you can get for 0
Comrade Syme and I 0
have had an experience 0
which it would take 0
more time to recount 0
than we can afford 0
if we are to 0
I will however relate 0
the occurrence in detail 0
even at the risk 0
of losing time if 0
you really feel that 0
it is essential to 0
the understanding of the 0
problem we have to 0
He was spinning out 0
his sentences making them 0
intolerably long and lingering 0
in the hope of 0
maddening the practical little 0
Doctor into an explosion 0
of impatience which might 0
But the little Doctor 0
continued only to stare 0
and smile and the 0
monologue was uphill work 0
Syme began to feel 0
a new sickness and 0
The Doctor s smile 0
and silence were not 0
at all like the 0
cataleptic stare and horrible 0
silence which he had 0
confronted in the Professor 0
half an hour before 0
About the Professor s 0
makeup and all his 0
antics there was always 0
something merely grotesque like 0
Syme remembered those wild 0
woes of yesterday as 0
one remembers being afraid 0
of Bogy in childhood 0
But here was daylight 0
here was a healthy 0
square shouldered man in 0
tweeds not odd save 0
for the accident of 0
his ugly spectacles not 0
glaring or grinning at 0
all but smiling steadily 0
and not saying a 0
The whole had a 0
sense of unbearable reality 0
Under the increasing sunlight 0
the colours of the 0
Doctor s complexion the 0
pattern of his tweeds 0
grew and expanded outrageously 0
as such things grow 0
too important in a 0
But his smile was 0
quite slight the pose 0
of his head polite 0
the only uncanny thing 0
As I say resumed 0
the Professor like a 0
man toiling through heavy 0
sand the incident that 0
has occurred to us 0
and has led us 0
to ask for information 0
about the Marquis is 0
one which you may 0
think it better to 0
but as it came 0
in the way of 0
Comrade Syme rather than 0
His words he seemed 0
to be dragging out 0
like words in an 0
but Syme who was 0
watching saw his long 0
fingers rattle quickly on 0
the edge of the 0
He read the message 0
You must go on 0
This devil has sucked 0
Syme plunged into the 0
breach with that bravado 0
of improvisation which always 0
came to him when 0
Yes the thing really 0
happened to me he 0
I had the good 0
fortune to fall into 0
conversation with a detective 0
who took me thanks 0
to my hat for 0
Wishing to clinch my 0
reputation for respectability I 0
took him and made 0
him very drunk at 0
Under this influence he 0
became friendly and told 0
me in so many 0
words that within a 0
day or two they 0
hope to arrest the 0
So unless you or 0
I can get on 0
The Doctor was still 0
smiling in the most 0
friendly way and his 0
protected eyes were still 0
The Professor signalled to 0
Syme that he would 0
resume his explanation and 0
he began again with 0
the same elaborate calm 0
Syme immediately brought this 0
information to me and 0
we came here together 0
to see what use 0
you would be inclined 0
to make of it 0
It seems to me 0
All this time Syme 0
had been staring at 0
the Doctor almost as 0
steadily as the Doctor 0
stared at the Professor 0
but quite without the 0
The nerves of both 0
comrades in arms were 0
near snapping under that 0
strain of motionless amiability 0
when Syme suddenly leant 0
forward and idly tapped 0
the edge of the 0
His message to his 0
ally ran I have 0
The Professor with scarcely 0
a pause in his 0
monologue signalled back Then 0
Syme telegraphed It is 0
The other answered Extraordinary 0
Syme said I am 0
The other retorted You 0
are a dead man 0
Syme had gone quite 0
red up to his 0
yellow hair and his 0
eyes were burning feverishly 0
As he said he 0
had an intuition and 0
it had risen to 0
a sort of lightheaded 0
Resuming his symbolic taps 0
he signalled to his 0
friend You scarcely realise 0
how poetic my intuition 0
It has that sudden 0
quality we sometimes feel 0
in the coming of 0
He then studied the 0
answer on his friend 0
The answer was Go 0
The Professor then resumed 0
his merely verbal monologue 0
addressed to the Doctor 0
Perhaps I should rather 0
say said Syme on 0
his fingers that it 0
resembles that sudden smell 0
of the sea which 0
may be found in 0
the heart of lush 0
His companion disdained to 0
Or yet again tapped 0
Syme it is positive 0
as is the passionate 0
red hair of a 0
The Professor was continuing 0
his speech but in 0
the middle of it 0
Syme decided to act 0
He leant across the 0
table and said in 0
a voice that could 0
The Doctor s sleek 0
and smiling head did 0
not move but they 0
could have sworn that 0
under his dark glasses 0
his eyes darted towards 0
Bull said Syme in 0
a voice peculiarly precise 0
and courteous would you 0
do me a small 0
Would you be so 0
kind as to take 0
The Professor swung round 0
on his seat and 0
stared at Syme with 0
a sort of frozen 0
Syme like a man 0
who has thrown his 0
life and fortune on 0
the table leaned forward 0
with a fiery face 0
The Doctor did not 0
For a few seconds 0
there was a silence 0
in which one could 0
hear a pin drop 0
split once by the 0
single hoot of a 0
distant steamer on the 0
Bull rose slowly still 0
smiling and took off 0
Syme sprang to his 0
feet stepping backwards a 0
little like a chemical 0
lecturer from a successful 0
His eyes were like 0
stars and for an 0
instant he could only 0
The Professor had also 0
started to his feet 0
forgetful of his supposed 0
He leant on the 0
back of the chair 0
and stared doubtfully at 0
Bull as if the 0
Doctor had been turned 0
into a toad before 0
And indeed it was 0
almost as great a 0
The two detectives saw 0
sitting in the chair 0
before them a very 0
boyish looking young man 0
with very frank and 0
happy hazel eyes an 0
open expression cockney clothes 0
like those of a 0
city clerk and an 0
unquestionable breath about him 0
of being very good 0
The smile was still 0
there but it might 0
have been the first 0
smile of a baby 0
I knew I was 0
a poet cried Syme 0
in a sort of 0
I knew my intuition 0
was as infallible as 0
It was the spectacles 0
It was all the 0
Given those beastly black 0
eyes and all the 0
rest of him his 0
health and his jolly 0
looks made him a 0
live devil among dead 0
It certainly does make 0
a queer difference said 0
But as regards the 0
roared Syme beside himself 0
Look at his face 0
look at his collar 0
look at his blessed 0
You don t suppose 0
do you that that 0
thing s an anarchist 0
cried the other in 0
Why by God said 0
Syme I ll take 0
the risk of that 0
Bull I am a 0
There s my card 0
and he flung down 0
the blue card upon 0
The Professor still feared 0
that all was lost 0
but he was loyal 0
He pulled out his 0
own official card and 0
put it beside his 0
Then the third man 0
burst out laughing and 0
for the first time 0
that morning they heard 0
I m awfully glad 0
you chaps have come 0
so early he said 0
with a sort of 0
schoolboy flippancy for we 0
can all start for 0
Yes I m in 0
the force right enough 0
and he flicked a 0
blue card towards them 0
lightly as a matter 0
Clapping a brisk bowler 0
on his head and 0
resuming his goblin glasses 0
the Doctor moved so 0
quickly towards the door 0
that the others instinctively 0
Syme seemed a little 0
distrait and as he 0
passed under the doorway 0
he suddenly struck his 0
stick on the stone 0
passage so that it 0
But Lord God Almighty 0
he cried out if 0
this is all right 0
there were more damned 0
detectives than there were 0
damned dynamiters at the 0
We might have fought 0
we were four against 0
The Professor was descending 0
the stairs but his 0
voice came up from 0
No said the voice 0
we were not four 0
against three we were 0
We were four against 0
The others went down 0
the stairs in silence 0
The young man called 0
Bull with an innocent 0
courtesy characteristic of him 0
insisted on going last 0
until they reached the 0
but there his own 0
robust rapidity asserted itself 0
unconsciously and he walked 0
quickly on ahead towards 0
a railway inquiry office 0
talking to the others 0
It is jolly to 0
get some pals he 0
I ve been half 0
dead with the jumps 0
I nearly flung my 0
arms round Gogol and 0
embraced him which would 0
I hope you won 0
t despise me for 0
having been in a 0
All the blue devils 0
in blue hell said 0
Syme contributed to my 0
But the worst devil 0
was you and your 0
The young man laughed 0
Wasn t it a 0
Such a simple idea 0
I haven t got 0
You see I wanted 0
to go into the 0
detective service especially the 0
But for that purpose 0
they wanted someone to 0
dress up as a 0
and they all swore 0
by blazes that I 0
could never look like 0
They said my very 0
walk was respectable and 0
that seen from behind 0
I looked like the 0
They said I looked 0
too healthy and too 0
optimistic and too reliable 0
they called me all 0
sorts of names at 0
They said that if 0
I had been a 0
criminal I might have 0
made my fortune by 0
looking so like an 0
but as I had 0
the misfortune to be 0
an honest man there 0
was not even the 0
remotest chance of my 0
assisting them by ever 0
looking like a criminal 0
But as last I 0
was brought before some 0
old josser who was 0
high up in the 0
force and who seemed 0
to have no end 0
of a head on 0
And there the others 0
One asked whether a 0
bushy beard would hide 0
another said that if 0
they blacked my face 0
I might look like 0
but this old chap 0
chipped in with a 0
A pair of smoked 0
spectacles will do it 0
Look at him now 0
he looks like an 0
Put him on a 0
pair of smoked spectacles 0
and children will scream 0
at the sight of 0
And so it was 0
When once my eyes 0
were covered all the 0
rest smile and big 0
shoulders and short hair 0
made me look a 0
As I say it 0
was simple enough when 0
it was done like 0
but that wasn t 0
the really miraculous part 0
There was one really 0
staggering thing about the 0
business and my head 0
still turns at it 0
I ll tell you 0
answered the man in 0
This big pot in 0
the police who sized 0
me up so that 0
he knew how the 0
goggles would go with 0
my hair and socks 0
by God he never 0
saw me at all 0
Syme s eyes suddenly 0
I thought you talked 0
So I did said 0
but we talked in 0
a pitch dark room 0
There you would never 0
I could not have 0
conceived it said Syme 0
It is indeed a 0
new idea said the 0
Their new ally was 0
in practical matters a 0
At the inquiry office 0
he asked with businesslike 0
brevity about the trains 0
Having got his information 0
he bundled the company 0
into a cab and 0
put them and himself 0
inside a railway carriage 0
before they had properly 0
realised the breathless process 0
They were already on 0
the Calais boat before 0
I had already arranged 0
he explained to go 0
to France for my 0
but I am delighted 0
to have someone to 0
You see I had 0
to send that beast 0
the Marquis over with 0
his bomb because the 0
President had his eye 0
on me though God 0
I ll tell you 0
the story some day 0
It was perfectly choking 0
Whenever I tried to 0
slip out of it 0
I saw the President 0
somewhere smiling out of 0
the bow window of 0
a club or taking 0
off his hat to 0
me from the top 0
I tell you you 0
can say what you 0
like that fellow sold 0
himself to the devil 0
he can be in 0
six places at once 0
So you sent the 0
Marquis off I understand 0
Was it long ago 0
Shall we be in 0
time to catch him 0
Yes answered the new 0
guide I ve timed 0
He ll still be 0
at Calais when we 0
But when we do 0
catch him at Calais 0
said the Professor what 0
are we going to 0
At this question the 0
Bull fell for the 0
He reflected a little 0
Theoretically I suppose we 0
ought to call the 0
Not I said Syme 0
Theoretically I ought to 0
I promised a poor 0
fellow who was a 0
real modern pessimist on 0
my word of honour 0
not to tell the 0
I m no hand 0
at casuistry but I 0
can t break my 0
word to a modern 0
It s like breaking 0
one s word to 0
I m in the 0
same boat said the 0
I tried to tell 0
the police and I 0
couldn t because of 0
some silly oath I 0
You see when I 0
was an actor I 0
was a sort of 0
Perjury or treason is 0
the only crime I 0
If I did that 0
I shouldn t know 0
the difference between right 0
I ve been through 0
all that said Dr 0
Bull and I ve 0
made up my mind 0
I gave my promise 0
to the Secretary you 0
know him man who 0
My friends that man 0
is the most utterly 0
unhappy man that was 0
It may be his 0
digestion or his conscience 0
or his nerves or 0
his philosophy of the 0
universe but he s 0
damned he s in 0
Well I can t 0
turn on a man 0
like that and hunt 0
It s like whipping 0
I may be mad 0
but that s how 0
and there s jolly 0
well the end of 0
I don t think 0
you re mad said 0
I knew you would 0
decide like that when 0
When first you took 0
Bull smiled a little 0
and strolled across the 0
deck to look at 0
Then he strolled back 0
again kicking his heels 0
carelessly and a companionable 0
silence fell between the 0
Well said Syme it 0
seems that we have 0
all the same kind 0
of morality or immorality 0
so we had better 0
face the fact that 0
Yes assented the Professor 0
you re quite right 0
and we must hurry 0
up for I can 0
see the Grey Nose 0
standing out from France 0
The fact that comes 0
of it said Syme 0
seriously is this that 0
we three are alone 0
Gogol has gone God 0
perhaps the President has 0
smashed him like a 0
On the Council we 0
are three men against 0
three like the Romans 0
who held the bridge 0
But we are worse 0
off than that first 0
because they can appeal 0
to their organization and 0
we cannot appeal to 0
ours and second because 0
Because one of those 0
other three men said 0
the Professor is not 0
Syme nodded and was 0
silent for a second 0
or two then he 0
My idea is this 0
We must do something 0
to keep the Marquis 0
in Calais till tomorrow 0
I have turned over 0
twenty schemes in my 0
We cannot denounce him 0
We cannot get him 0
detained on some trivial 0
charge for we should 0
he knows us and 0
he would smell a 0
We cannot pretend to 0
keep him on anarchist 0
he might swallow much 0
in that way but 0
not the notion of 0
stopping in Calais while 0
the Czar went safely 0
We might try to 0
kidnap him and lock 0
but he is a 0
well known man here 0
He has a whole 0
he is very strong 0
and brave and the 0
The only thing I 0
can see to do 0
is actually to take 0
advantage of the very 0
things that are in 0
the Marquis s favour 0
I am going to 0
profit by the fact 0
that he is a 0
I am going to 0
profit by the fact 0
that he has many 0
friends and moves in 0
What the devil are 0
The Symes are first 0
mentioned in the fourteenth 0
but there is a 0
tradition that one of 0
them rode behind Bruce 0
Since 1350 the tree 0
He s gone off 0
his head said the 0
Our bearings continued Syme 0
calmly are argent a 0
chevron gules charged with 0
three cross crosslets of 0
The Professor seized Syme 0
roughly by the waistcoat 0
We are just inshore 0
Are you seasick or 0
joking in the wrong 0
My remarks are almost 0
painfully practical answered Syme 0
in an unhurried manner 0
The house of St 0
Eustache also is very 0
The Marquis cannot deny 0
that he is a 0
He cannot deny that 0
I am a gentleman 0
And in order to 0
put the matter of 0
my social position quite 0
beyond a doubt I 0
propose at the earliest 0
opportunity to knock his 0
But here we are 0
They went on shore 0
under the strong sun 0
in a sort of 0
Syme who had now 0
taken the lead as 0
Bull had taken it 0
in London led them 0
along a kind of 0
marine parade until he 0
came to some cafes 0
embowered in a bulk 0
of greenery and overlooking 0
As he went before 0
them his step was 0
slightly swaggering and he 0
swung his stick like 0
He was making apparently 0
for the extreme end 0
of the line of 0
cafes but he stopped 0
With a sharp gesture 0
he motioned them to 0
silence but he pointed 0
with one gloved finger 0
to a cafe table 0
under a bank of 0
flowering foliage at which 0
sat the Marquis de 0
Eustache his teeth shining 0
in his thick black 0
beard and his bold 0
brown face shadowed by 0
a light yellow straw 0
hat and outlined against 0
CHAPTER X THE DUEL 0
SYME sat down at 0
a cafe table with 0
his companions his blue 0
eyes sparkling like the 0
bright sea below and 0
ordered a bottle of 0
Saumur with a pleased 0
He was for some 0
reason in a condition 0
His spirits were already 0
they rose as the 0
Saumur sank and in 0
half an hour his 0
talk was a torrent 0
He professed to be 0
making out a plan 0
of the conversation which 0
was going to ensue 0
between himself and the 0
He jotted it down 0
wildly with a pencil 0
It was arranged like 0
a printed catechism with 0
questions and answers and 0
was delivered with an 0
extraordinary rapidity of utterance 0
Before taking off his 0
hat I shall take 0
I shall say The 0
Marquis de Saint Eustache 0
He will say The 0
celebrated Mr Syme I 0
He will say in 0
the most exquisite French 0
I shall reply in 0
the most exquisite Cockney 0
Oh just the Syme 0
Oh shut it said 0
the man in spectacles 0
Pull yourself together and 0
chuck away that bit 0
What are you really 0
But it was a 0
lovely catechism said Syme 0
Do let me read 0
It has only forty 0
three questions and answers 0
and some of the 0
Marquis s answers are 0
I like to be 0
just to my enemy 0
But what s the 0
good of it all 0
It leads up to 0
my challenge don t 0
you see said Syme 0
When the Marquis has 0
given the thirty ninth 0
Has it by any 0
chance occurred to you 0
asked the Professor with 0
a ponderous simplicity that 0
the Marquis may not 0
say all the forty 0
three things you have 0
put down for him 0
In that case I 0
understand your own epigrams 0
may appear somewhat more 0
Syme struck the table 0
with a radiant face 0
Why how true that 0
is he said and 0
I never thought of 0
Sir you have an 0
intellect beyond the common 0
You will make a 0
Oh you re as 0
drunk as an owl 0
It only remains continued 0
Syme quite unperturbed to 0
adopt some other method 0
of breaking the ice 0
if I may so 0
between myself and the 0
man I wish to 0
And since the course 0
of a dialogue cannot 0
be predicted by one 0
of its parties alone 0
as you have pointed 0
out with such recondite 0
the only thing to 0
be done I suppose 0
is for the one 0
party as far as 0
possible to do all 0
the dialogue by himself 0
And so I will 0
And he stood up 0
suddenly his yellow hair 0
blowing in the slight 0
A band was playing 0
in a cafe chantant 0
hidden somewhere among the 0
trees and a woman 0
had just stopped singing 0
On Syme s heated 0
head the bray of 0
the brass band seemed 0
like the jar and 0
jingle of that barrel 0
organ in Leicester Square 0
to the tune of 0
which he had once 0
stood up to die 0
He looked across to 0
the little table where 0
The man had two 0
companions now solemn Frenchmen 0
in frock coats and 0
silk hats one of 0
them with the red 0
rosette of the Legion 0
of Honour evidently people 0
of a solid social 0
Besides these black cylindrical 0
costumes the Marquis in 0
his loose straw hat 0
and light spring clothes 0
looked Bohemian and even 0
but he looked the 0
Indeed one might say 0
that he looked the 0
king with his animal 0
elegance his scornful eyes 0
and his proud head 0
lifted against the purple 0
But he was no 0
Christian king at any 0
he was rather some 0
swarthy despot half Greek 0
half Asiatic who in 0
the days when slavery 0
seemed natural looked down 0
on the Mediterranean on 0
his galley and his 0
Just so Syme thought 0
would the brown gold 0
face of such a 0
tyrant have shown against 0
the dark green olives 0
and the burning blue 0
Are you going to 0
asked the Professor peevishly 0
seeing that Syme still 0
stood up without moving 0
Syme drained his last 0
glass of sparkling wine 0
I am he said 0
pointing across to the 0
Marquis and his companions 0
That meeting displeases me 0
I am going to 0
pull that meeting s 0
great ugly mahogany coloured 0
He stepped across swiftly 0
if not quite steadily 0
The Marquis seeing him 0
arched his black Assyrian 0
eyebrows in surprise but 0
You are Mr Syme 0
I think he said 0
And you are the 0
Marquis de Saint Eustache 0
Permit me to pull 0
He leant over to 0
do so but the 0
Marquis started backwards upsetting 0
his chair and the 0
two men in top 0
hats held Syme back 0
This man has insulted 0
said Syme with gestures 0
cried the gentleman with 0
the red rosette when 0
Oh just now said 0
He insulted my mother 0
exclaimed the gentleman incredulously 0
Well anyhow said Syme 0
conceding a point my 0
But how can the 0
Marquis have insulted your 0
said the second gentleman 0
with some legitimate wonder 0
He has been sitting 0
here all the time 0
Ah it was what 0
I said nothing at 0
all said the Marquis 0
except something about the 0
I only said that 0
I liked Wagner played 0
It was an allusion 0
to my family said 0
My aunt played Wagner 0
It was a painful 0
We are always being 0
This seems most extraordinary 0
said the gentleman who 0
was decore looking doubtfully 0
Oh I assure you 0
said Syme earnestly the 0
whole of your conversation 0
was simply packed with 0
sinister allusions to my 0
said the second gentleman 0
I for one have 0
said nothing for half 0
an hour except that 0
I liked the singing 0
of that girl with 0
Well there you are 0
My aunt s was 0
It seems to me 0
said the other that 0
you are simply seeking 0
a pretext to insult 0
said Syme facing round 0
and looking at him 0
what a clever chap 0
The Marquis started up 0
with eyes flaming like 0
Seeking a quarrel with 0
Seeking a fight with 0
there was never a 0
man who had to 0
These gentlemen will perhaps 0
There are still four 0
Let us fight this 0
Syme bowed with a 0
Marquis he said your 0
action is worthy of 0
your fame and blood 0
Permit me to consult 0
for a moment with 0
the gentlemen in whose 0
hands I shall place 0
In three long strides 0
he rejoined his companions 0
and they who had 0
seen his champagne inspired 0
attack and listened to 0
his idiotic explanations were 0
quite startled at the 0
For now that he 0
came back to them 0
he was quite sober 0
a little pale and 0
he spoke in a 0
low voice of passionate 0
I have done it 0
I have fixed a 0
fight on the beast 0
But look here and 0
There is no time 0
You are my seconds 0
and everything must come 0
Now you must insist 0
and insist absolutely on 0
the duel coming off 0
after seven tomorrow so 0
as to give me 0
the chance of preventing 0
him from catching the 0
If he misses that 0
he misses his crime 0
He can t refuse 0
to meet you on 0
such a small point 0
of time and place 0
But this is what 0
He will choose a 0
field somewhere near a 0
wayside station where he 0
can pick up the 0
He is a very 0
good swordsman and he 0
will trust to killing 0
me in time to 0
But I can fence 0
well too and I 0
think I can keep 0
him in play at 0
any rate until the 0
Then perhaps he may 0
kill me to console 0
Very well then let 0
me introduce you to 0
some charming friends of 0
mine and leading them 0
quickly across the parade 0
he presented them to 0
the Marquis s seconds 0
by two very aristocratic 0
names of which they 0
had not previously heard 0
Syme was subject to 0
spasms of singular common 0
sense not otherwise a 0
part of his character 0
as he said of 0
his impulse about the 0
poetic intuitions and they 0
sometimes rose to the 0
He had correctly calculated 0
in this case the 0
policy of his opponent 0
When the Marquis was 0
informed by his seconds 0
that Syme could only 0
fight in the morning 0
he must fully have 0
realised that an obstacle 0
had suddenly arisen between 0
him and his bomb 0
throwing business in the 0
Naturally he could not 0
explain this objection to 0
his friends so he 0
chose the course which 0
He induced his seconds 0
to settle on a 0
small meadow not far 0
from the railway and 0
he trusted to the 0
fatality of the first 0
When he came down 0
very coolly to the 0
field of honour no 0
one could have guessed 0
that he had any 0
anxiety about a journey 0
his hands were in 0
his pockets his straw 0
hat on the back 0
of his head his 0
handsome face brazen in 0
But it might have 0
struck a stranger as 0
odd that there appeared 0
in his train not 0
only his seconds carrying 0
the sword case but 0
two of his servants 0
carrying a portmanteau and 0
Early as was the 0
hour the sun soaked 0
everything in warmth and 0
Syme was vaguely surprised 0
to see so many 0
spring flowers burning gold 0
and silver in the 0
tall grass in which 0
the whole company stood 0
With the exception of 0
the Marquis all the 0
men were in sombre 0
and solemn morning dress 0
with hats like black 0
the little Doctor especially 0
with the addition of 0
his black spectacles looked 0
like an undertaker in 0
Syme could not help 0
feeling a comic contrast 0
between this funereal church 0
parade of apparel and 0
the rich and glistening 0
meadow growing wild flowers 0
But indeed this comic 0
contrast between the yellow 0
blossoms and the black 0
hats was but a 0
symbol of the tragic 0
contrast between the yellow 0
blossoms and the black 0
On his right was 0
far away to his 0
left lay the long 0
curve of the railway 0
line which he was 0
so to speak guarding 0
from the Marquis whose 0
goal and escape it 0
In front of him 0
behind the black group 0
of his opponents he 0
could see like a 0
tinted cloud a small 0
almond bush in flower 0
against the faint line 0
The member of the 0
Legion of Honour whose 0
name it seemed was 0
Colonel Ducroix approached the 0
Bull with great politeness 0
and suggested that the 0
play should terminate with 0
the first considerable hurt 0
Bull however having been 0
carefully coached by Syme 0
upon this point of 0
policy insisted with great 0
dignity and in very 0
bad French that it 0
should continue until one 0
of the combatants was 0
Syme had made up 0
his mind that he 0
could avoid disabling the 0
Marquis and prevent the 0
Marquis from disabling him 0
for at least twenty 0
In twenty minutes the 0
Paris train would have 0
To a man of 0
the well known skill 0
and valour of Monsieur 0
Eustache said the Professor 0
solemnly it must be 0
a matter of indifference 0
which method is adopted 0
and our principal has 0
strong reasons for demanding 0
the longer encounter reasons 0
the delicacy of which 0
prevent me from being 0
explicit but for the 0
just and honourable nature 0
of which I can 0
broke from the Marquis 0
behind whose face had 0
suddenly darkened let us 0
stop talking and begin 0
and he slashed off 0
the head of a 0
tall flower with his 0
Syme understood his rude 0
impatience and instinctively looked 0
over his shoulder to 0
see whether the train 0
was coming in sight 0
But there was no 0
smoke on the horizon 0
Colonel Ducroix knelt down 0
and unlocked the case 0
taking out a pair 0
of twin swords which 0
took the sunlight and 0
turned to two streaks 0
He offered one to 0
the Marquis who snatched 0
it without ceremony and 0
another to Syme who 0
took it bent it 0
and poised it with 0
as much delay as 0
was consistent with dignity 0
Then the Colonel took 0
out another pair of 0
blades and taking one 0
himself and giving another 0
Bull proceeded to place 0
Both combatants had thrown 0
off their coats and 0
waistcoats and stood sword 0
The seconds stood on 0
each side of the 0
line of fight with 0
drawn swords also but 0
still sombre in their 0
dark frock coats and 0
The Colonel said quietly 0
and the two blades 0
When the jar of 0
the joined iron ran 0
up Syme s arm 0
all the fantastic fears 0
that have been the 0
subject of this story 0
fell from him like 0
dreams from a man 0
waking up in bed 0
He remembered them clearly 0
and in order as 0
mere delusions of the 0
nerves how the fear 0
of the Professor had 0
been the fear of 0
the tyrannic accidents of 0
nightmare and how the 0
fear of the Doctor 0
had been the fear 0
of the airless vacuum 0
The first was the 0
old fear that any 0
miracle might happen the 0
second the more hopeless 0
modern fear that no 0
miracle can ever happen 0
But he saw that 0
these fears were fancies 0
for he found himself 0
in the presence of 0
the great fact of 0
the fear of death 0
with its coarse and 0
He felt like a 0
man who had dreamed 0
all night of falling 0
over precipices and had 0
woke up on the 0
morning when he was 0
For as soon as 0
he had seen the 0
sunlight run down the 0
channel of his foe 0
s foreshortened blade and 0
as soon as he 0
had felt the two 0
tongues of steel touch 0
vibrating like two living 0
things he knew that 0
his enemy was a 0
terrible fighter and that 0
probably his last hour 0
He felt a strange 0
and vivid value in 0
all the earth around 0
him in the grass 0
he felt the love 0
of life in all 0
He could almost fancy 0
that he heard the 0
he could almost fancy 0
that even as he 0
stood fresh flowers were 0
springing up and breaking 0
into blossom in the 0
meadow flowers blood red 0
and burning gold and 0
blue fulfilling the whole 0
pageant of the spring 0
And whenever his eyes 0
strayed for a flash 0
from the calm staring 0
hypnotic eyes of the 0
Marquis they saw the 0
little tuft of almond 0
tree against the sky 0
He had the feeling 0
that if by some 0
miracle he escaped he 0
would be ready to 0
sit for ever before 0
that almond tree desiring 0
nothing else in the 0
But while earth and 0
sky and everything had 0
the living beauty of 0
a thing lost the 0
other half of his 0
head was as clear 0
as glass and he 0
was parrying his enemy 0
s point with a 0
kind of clockwork skill 0
of which he had 0
hardly supposed himself capable 0
Once his enemy s 0
point ran along his 0
wrist leaving a slight 0
streak of blood but 0
it either was not 0
noticed or was tacitly 0
Every now and then 0
he riposted and once 0
or twice he could 0
almost fancy that he 0
felt his point go 0
home but as there 0
was no blood on 0
blade or shirt he 0
supposed he was mistaken 0
Then came an interruption 0
At the risk of 0
losing all the Marquis 0
interrupting his quiet stare 0
flashed one glance over 0
his shoulder at the 0
line of railway on 0
Then he turned on 0
Syme a face transfigured 0
to that of a 0
fiend and began to 0
fight as if with 0
The attack came so 0
fast and furious that 0
the one shining sword 0
seemed a shower of 0
Syme had no chance 0
to look at the 0
but also he had 0
He could guess the 0
reason of the Marquis 0
s sudden madness of 0
battle the Paris train 0
But the Marquis s 0
morbid energy over reached 0
Twice Syme parrying knocked 0
his opponent s point 0
far out of the 0
and the third time 0
his riposte was so 0
rapid that there was 0
no doubt about the 0
Syme s sword actually 0
bent under the weight 0
of the Marquis s 0
body which it had 0
Syme was as certain 0
that he had stuck 0
his blade into his 0
enemy as a gardener 0
that he has stuck 0
his spade into the 0
Yet the Marquis sprang 0
back from the stroke 0
without a stagger and 0
Syme stood staring at 0
his own sword point 0
There was no blood 0
on it at all 0
There was an instant 0
of rigid silence and 0
then Syme in his 0
turn fell furiously on 0
the other filled with 0
The Marquis was probably 0
in a general sense 0
a better fencer than 0
he as he had 0
surmised at the beginning 0
but at the moment 0
the Marquis seemed distraught 0
and at a disadvantage 0
He fought wildly and 0
even weakly and he 0
constantly looked away at 0
the railway line almost 0
as if he feared 0
the train more than 0
Syme on the other 0
hand fought fiercely but 0
still carefully in an 0
intellectual fury eager to 0
solve the riddle of 0
his own bloodless sword 0
For this purpose he 0
aimed less at the 0
Marquis s body and 0
more at his throat 0
A minute and a 0
half afterwards he felt 0
his point enter the 0
man s neck below 0
It came out clean 0
Half mad he thrust 0
again and made what 0
should have been a 0
bloody scar on the 0
But there was no 0
For one moment the 0
heaven of Syme again 0
grew black with supernatural 0
Surely the man had 0
But this new spiritual 0
dread was a more 0
awful thing than had 0
been the mere spiritual 0
topsy turvydom symbolised by 0
the paralytic who pursued 0
The Professor was only 0
this man was a 0
devil perhaps he was 0
Anyhow this was certain 0
that three times had 0
a human sword been 0
driven into him and 0
When Syme had that 0
thought he drew himself 0
up and all that 0
was good in him 0
sang high up in 0
the air as a 0
high wind sings in 0
He thought of all 0
the human things in 0
his story of the 0
Chinese lanterns in Saffron 0
Park of the girl 0
s red hair in 0
the garden of the 0
honest beer swilling sailors 0
down by the dock 0
of his loyal companions 0
Perhaps he had been 0
chosen as a champion 0
of all these fresh 0
and kindly things to 0
cross swords with the 0
enemy of all creation 0
After all he said 0
to himself I am 0
more than a devil 0
I am a man 0
I can do the 0
one thing which Satan 0
himself cannot do I 0
can die and as 0
the word went through 0
his head he heard 0
a faint and far 0
off hoot which would 0
soon be the roar 0
of the Paris train 0
He fell to fighting 0
again with a supernatural 0
levity like a Mohammedan 0
As the train came 0
nearer and nearer he 0
fancied he could see 0
people putting up the 0
floral arches in Paris 0
he joined in the 0
growing noise and the 0
glory of the great 0
Republic whose gate he 0
was guarding against Hell 0
His thoughts rose higher 0
and higher with the 0
rising roar of the 0
train which ended as 0
if proudly in a 0
long and piercing whistle 0
Suddenly to the astonishment 0
of everyone the Marquis 0
sprang back quite out 0
of sword reach and 0
threw down his sword 0
The leap was wonderful 0
and not the less 0
wonderful because Syme had 0
plunged his sword a 0
moment before into the 0
said the Marquis in 0
a voice that compelled 0
I want to say 0
What is the matter 0
asked Colonel Ducroix staring 0
Has there been foul 0
There has been foul 0
play somewhere said Dr 0
Bull who was a 0
Our principal has wounded 0
the Marquis four times 0
at least and he 0
is none the worse 0
The Marquis put up 0
his hand with a 0
curious air of ghastly 0
Please let me speak 0
It is rather important 0
Syme he continued turning 0
to his opponent we 0
are fighting today if 0
I remember right because 0
you expressed a wish 0
which I thought irrational 0
to pull my nose 0
Would you oblige me 0
by pulling my nose 0
now as quickly as 0
I have to catch 0
I protest that this 0
is most irregular said 0
It is certainly somewhat 0
opposed to precedent said 0
Colonel Ducroix looking wistfully 0
There is I think 0
one case on record 0
Captain Bellegarde and the 0
in which the weapons 0
were changed in the 0
middle of the encounter 0
at the request of 0
one of the combatants 0
But one can hardly 0
call one s nose 0
Will you or will 0
you not pull my 0
said the Marquis in 0
Come come Mr Syme 0
You wanted to do 0
You can have no 0
conception of how important 0
it is to me 0
Don t be so 0
Pull my nose at 0
once when I ask 0
and he bent slightly 0
forward with a fascinating 0
The Paris train panting 0
and groaning had grated 0
into a little station 0
behind the neighbouring hill 0
Syme had the feeling 0
he had more than 0
once had in these 0
adventures the sense that 0
a horrible and sublime 0
wave lifted to heaven 0
was just toppling over 0
Walking in a world 0
he half understood he 0
took two paces forward 0
and seized the Roman 0
nose of this remarkable 0
He pulled it hard 0
and it came off 0
He stood for some 0
seconds with a foolish 0
solemnity with the pasteboard 0
proboscis still between his 0
fingers looking at it 0
while the sun and 0
the clouds and the 0
wooded hills looked down 0
upon this imbecile scene 0
The Marquis broke the 0
silence in a loud 0
If anyone has any 0
use for my left 0
eyebrow he said he 0
Colonel Ducroix do accept 0
It s the kind 0
of thing that might 0
come in useful any 0
day and he gravely 0
tore off one of 0
his swarthy Assyrian brows 0
bringing about half his 0
brown forehead with it 0
and politely offered it 0
to the Colonel who 0
stood crimson and speechless 0
If I had known 0
he spluttered that I 0
was acting for a 0
poltroon who pads himself 0
Oh I know I 0
said the Marquis recklessly 0
throwing various parts of 0
himself right and left 0
You are making a 0
but it can t 0
be explained just now 0
I tell you the 0
train has come into 0
Bull fiercely and the 0
train shall go out 0
It shall go out 0
We know well enough 0
for what devil s 0
The mysterious Marquis lifted 0
his hands with a 0
He was a strange 0
scarecrow standing there in 0
the sun with half 0
his old face peeled 0
off and half another 0
face glaring and grinning 0
Will you drive me 0
You shall not go 0
by the train said 0
Syme firmly and grasped 0
The wild figure turned 0
towards Syme and seemed 0
to be gathering itself 0
for a sublime effort 0
You great fat blasted 0
blear eyed blundering thundering 0
brainless Godforsaken doddering damned 0
he said without taking 0
You great silly pink 0
You shall not go 0
by this train repeated 0
And why the infernal 0
blazes roared the other 0
should I want to 0
go by the train 0
We know all said 0
You are going to 0
Paris to throw a 0
Going to Jericho to 0
cried the other tearing 0
his hair which came 0
Have you all got 0
softening of the brain 0
that you don t 0
realise what I am 0
Did you really think 0
I wanted to catch 0
Twenty Paris trains might 0
go by for me 0
Then what did you 0
What did I care 0
I didn t care 0
about catching the train 0
I cared about whether 0
the train caught me 0
and now by God 0
it has caught me 0
I regret to inform 0
you said Syme with 0
restraint that your remarks 0
convey no impression to 0
Perhaps if you were 0
to remove the remains 0
of your original forehead 0
and some portion of 0
what was once your 0
chin your meaning would 0
Mental lucidity fulfils itself 0
What do you mean 0
by saying that the 0
train has caught you 0
It may be my 0
literary fancy but somehow 0
I feel that it 0
ought to mean something 0
It means everything said 0
the other and the 0
Sunday has us now 0
in the hollow of 0
repeated the Professor as 0
What do you mean 0
The police of course 0
said the Marquis and 0
tore off his scalp 0
and half his face 0
The head which emerged 0
was the blonde well 0
brushed smooth haired head 0
which is common in 0
the English constabulary but 0
the face was terribly 0
I am Inspector Ratcliffe 0
he said with a 0
sort of haste that 0
My name is pretty 0
well known to the 0
police and I can 0
see well enough that 0
you belong to them 0
But if there is 0
any doubt about my 0
position I have a 0
card and he began 0
to pull a blue 0
card from his pocket 0
The Professor gave a 0
Oh don t show 0
it us he said 0
we ve got enough 0
of them to equip 0
The little man named 0
Bull had like many 0
men who seem to 0
be of a mere 0
vivacious vulgarity sudden movements 0
Here he certainly saved 0
In the midst of 0
this staggering transformation scene 0
he stepped forward with 0
all the gravity and 0
responsibility of a second 0
and addressed the two 0
seconds of the Marquis 0
Gentlemen he said we 0
all owe you a 0
but I assure you 0
that you have not 0
been made the victims 0
of such a low 0
joke as you imagine 0
or indeed of anything 0
undignified in a man 0
You have not wasted 0
you have helped to 0
We are not buffoons 0
but very desperate men 0
at war with a 0
A secret society of 0
anarchists is hunting us 0
not such unfortunate madmen 0
as may here or 0
there throw a bomb 0
through starvation or German 0
philosophy but a rich 0
and powerful and fanatical 0
church a church of 0
eastern pessimism which holds 0
it holy to destroy 0
How hard they hunt 0
us you can gather 0
from the fact that 0
we are driven to 0
such disguises as those 0
for which I apologise 0
and to such pranks 0
as this one by 0
The younger second of 0
the Marquis a short 0
man with a black 0
moustache bowed politely and 0
Of course I accept 0
but you will in 0
your turn forgive me 0
if I decline to 0
follow you further into 0
your difficulties and permit 0
myself to say good 0
The sight of an 0
acquaintance and distinguished fellow 0
townsman coming to pieces 0
in the open air 0
is unusual and upon 0
the whole sufficient for 0
Colonel Ducroix I would 0
in no way influence 0
your actions but if 0
you feel with me 0
that our present society 0
is a little abnormal 0
I am now going 0
to walk back to 0
Colonel Ducroix moved mechanically 0
but then tugged abruptly 0
at his white moustache 0
If these gentlemen are 0
really in a mess 0
with a lot of 0
low wreckers like that 0
I ll see them 0
I have fought for 0
France and it is 0
hard if I can 0
t fight for civilization 0
Bull took off his 0
hat and waved it 0
cheering as at a 0
Don t make too 0
much noise said Inspector 0
Ratcliffe Sunday may hear 0
cried Bull and dropped 0
Yes retorted Ratcliffe he 0
may be with them 0
With the people out 0
of that train said 0
What you say seems 0
utterly wild began Syme 0
Why as a matter 0
of fact But my 0
God he cried out 0
suddenly like a man 0
who sees an explosion 0
a long way off 0
if this is true 0
the whole bally lot 0
of us on the 0
Anarchist Council were against 0
Every born man was 0
a detective except the 0
President and his personal 0
What can it mean 0
said the new policeman 0
It means that we 0
Don t you know 0
Don t you know 0
that his jokes are 0
always so big and 0
simple that one has 0
never thought of them 0
Can you think of 0
anything more like Sunday 0
than this that he 0
should put all his 0
powerful enemies on the 0
Supreme Council and then 0
take care that it 0
I tell you he 0
has bought every trust 0
he has captured every 0
cable he has control 0
of every railway line 0
especially of that railway 0
and he pointed a 0
shaking finger towards the 0
The whole movement was 0
half the world was 0
ready to rise for 0
But there were just 0
five people perhaps who 0
would have resisted him 0
and the old devil 0
put them on the 0
Supreme Council to waste 0
their time in watching 0
Idiots that we are 0
he planned the whole 0
Sunday knew that the 0
Professor would chase Syme 0
through London and that 0
Syme would fight me 0
And he was combining 0
great masses of capital 0
and seizing great lines 0
of telegraphy while we 0
five idiots were running 0
after each other like 0
a lot of confounded 0
babies playing blind man 0
asked Syme with a 0
Well replied the other 0
with sudden serenity he 0
has found us playing 0
blind man s buff 0
today in a field 0
of great rustic beauty 0
He has probably captured 0
it only remains to 0
him to capture this 0
field and all the 0
And since you really 0
want to know what 0
was my objection to 0
the arrival of that 0
train I will tell 0
My objection was that 0
Sunday or his Secretary 0
has just this moment 0
got out of it 0
Syme uttered an involuntary 0
cry and they all 0
turned their eyes towards 0
the far off station 0
It was quite true 0
that a considerable bulk 0
of people seemed to 0
be moving in their 0
But they were too 0
distant to be distinguished 0
It was a habit 0
of the late Marquis 0
Eustache said the new 0
policeman producing a leather 0
case always to carry 0
a pair of opera 0
Either the President or 0
the Secretary is coming 0
after us with that 0
They have caught us 0
in a nice quiet 0
place where we are 0
under no temptations to 0
break our oaths by 0
Bull I have a 0
suspicion that you will 0
see better through these 0
than through your own 0
He handed the field 0
glasses to the Doctor 0
who immediately took off 0
his spectacles and put 0
the apparatus to his 0
It cannot be as 0
bad as you say 0
said the Professor somewhat 0
There are a good 0
number of them certainly 0
but they may easily 0
Do ordinary tourists asked 0
Bull with the fieldglasses 0
to his eyes wear 0
black masks half way 0
Syme almost tore the 0
glasses out of his 0
hand and looked through 0
Most men in the 0
advancing mob really looked 0
but it was quite 0
true that two or 0
three of the leaders 0
in front wore black 0
half masks almost down 0
This disguise is very 0
complete especially at such 0
a distance and Syme 0
found it impossible to 0
conclude anything from the 0
clean shaven jaws and 0
chins of the men 0
talking in the front 0
But presently as they 0
talked they all smiled 0
and one of them 0
smiled on one side 0
CHAPTER XI THE CRIMINALS 0
SYME put the field 0
glasses from his eyes 0
with an almost ghastly 0
The President is not 0
with them anyhow he 0
said and wiped his 0
But surely they are 0
right away on the 0
horizon said the bewildered 0
Colonel blinking and but 0
half recovered from Bull 0
s hasty though polite 0
Could you possibly know 0
your President among all 0
Could I know a 0
white elephant among all 0
answered Syme somewhat irritably 0
As you very truly 0
say they are on 0
but if he were 0
I believe this ground 0
After an instant s 0
pause the new man 0
called Ratcliffe said with 0
Of course the President 0
isn t with them 0
I wish to Gemini 0
Much more likely the 0
President is riding in 0
triumph through Paris or 0
sitting on the ruins 0
Something may have happened 0
but he cannot have 0
carried the world with 0
a rush like that 0
It is quite true 0
he added frowning dubiously 0
at the distant fields 0
that lay towards the 0
little station it is 0
certainly true that there 0
seems to be a 0
crowd coming this way 0
but they are not 0
all the army that 0
Oh they said the 0
no they are not 0
a very valuable force 0
But let me tell 0
you frankly that they 0
are precisely calculated to 0
our value we are 0
not much my boy 0
in Sunday s universe 0
He has got hold 0
of all the cables 0
But to kill the 0
Supreme Council he regards 0
as a trivial matter 0
like a post card 0
it may be left 0
to his private secretary 0
and he spat on 0
Then he turned to 0
the others and said 0
There is a great 0
deal to be said 0
but if anyone has 0
any preference for the 0
other alternative I strongly 0
advise him to walk 0
With these words he 0
turned his broad back 0
and strode with silent 0
energy towards the wood 0
The others gave one 0
glance over their shoulders 0
and saw that the 0
dark cloud of men 0
had detached itself from 0
the station and was 0
moving with a mysterious 0
discipline across the plain 0
They saw already even 0
with the naked eye 0
black blots on the 0
foremost faces which marked 0
the masks they wore 0
They turned and followed 0
their leader who had 0
already struck the wood 0
and disappeared among the 0
The sun on the 0
grass was dry and 0
So in plunging into 0
the wood they had 0
a cool shock of 0
shadow as of divers 0
who plunge into a 0
The inside of the 0
wood was full of 0
shattered sunlight and shaken 0
They made a sort 0
of shuddering veil almost 0
recalling the dizziness of 0
Even the solid figures 0
walking with him Syme 0
could hardly see for 0
the patterns of sun 0
and shade that danced 0
Now a man s 0
head was lit as 0
with a light of 0
Rembrandt leaving all else 0
now again he had 0
strong and staring white 0
hands with the face 0
The ex Marquis had 0
pulled the old straw 0
hat over his eyes 0
and the black shade 0
of the brim cut 0
his face so squarely 0
in two that it 0
seemed to be wearing 0
one of the black 0
half masks of their 0
The fancy tinted Syme 0
s overwhelming sense of 0
Was he wearing a 0
Was anyone wearing a 0
This wood of witchery 0
in which men s 0
faces turned black and 0
white by turns in 0
which their figures first 0
swelled into sunlight and 0
then faded into formless 0
night this mere chaos 0
after the clear daylight 0
seemed to Syme a 0
perfect symbol of the 0
world in which he 0
had been moving for 0
three days this world 0
where men took off 0
their beards and their 0
spectacles and their noses 0
and turned into other 0
That tragic self confidence 0
which he had felt 0
when he believed that 0
the Marquis was a 0
devil had strangely disappeared 0
now that he knew 0
that the Marquis was 0
He felt almost inclined 0
to ask after all 0
these bewilderments what was 0
a friend and what 0
Was there anything that 0
was apart from what 0
The Marquis had taken 0
off his nose and 0
turned out to be 0
Might he not just 0
as well take off 0
his head and turn 0
out to be a 0
Was not everything after 0
all like this bewildering 0
woodland this dance of 0
Everything only a glimpse 0
the glimpse always unforeseen 0
For Gabriel Syme had 0
found in the heart 0
of that sun splashed 0
wood what many modern 0
painters had found there 0
He had found the 0
thing which the modern 0
people call Impressionism which 0
is another name for 0
that final scepticism which 0
can find no floor 0
As a man in 0
an evil dream strains 0
himself to scream and 0
wake Syme strove with 0
a sudden effort to 0
fling off this last 0
and worst of his 0
With two impatient strides 0
he overtook the man 0
in the Marquis s 0
straw hat the man 0
whom he had come 0
to address as Ratcliffe 0
In a voice exaggeratively 0
loud and cheerful he 0
broke the bottomless silence 0
May I ask he 0
said where on earth 0
we are all going 0
So genuine had been 0
the doubts of his 0
soul that he was 0
quite glad to hear 0
his companion speak in 0
an easy human voice 0
We must get down 0
through the town of 0
Lancy to the sea 0
I think that part 0
of the country is 0
least likely to be 0
What can you mean 0
They can t be 0
running the real world 0
Surely not many working 0
men are anarchists and 0
surely if they were 0
mere mobs could not 0
beat modern armies and 0
repeated his new friend 0
with a snort of 0
So you talk about 0
mobs and the working 0
classes as if they 0
You ve got that 0
eternal idiotic idea that 0
if anarchy came it 0
would come from the 0
The poor have been 0
rebels but they have 0
they have more interest 0
than anyone else in 0
there being some decent 0
The poor man really 0
has a stake in 0
The rich man hasn 0
he can go away 0
to New Guinea in 0
The poor have sometimes 0
objected to being governed 0
the rich have always 0
objected to being governed 0
Aristocrats were always anarchists 0
as you can see 0
from the barons wars 0
As a lecture on 0
English history for the 0
little ones said Syme 0
this is all very 0
but I have not 0
yet grasped its application 0
Its application is said 0
his informant that most 0
of old Sunday s 0
right hand men are 0
South African and American 0
That is why he 0
has got hold of 0
and that is why 0
the last four champions 0
of the anti anarchist 0
police force are running 0
through a wood like 0
Millionaires I can understand 0
said Syme thoughtfully they 0
are nearly all mad 0
But getting hold of 0
a few wicked old 0
gentlemen with hobbies is 0
getting hold of great 0
Christian nations is another 0
I would bet the 0
nose off my face 0
that Sunday would stand 0
perfectly helpless before the 0
task of converting any 0
ordinary healthy person anywhere 0
Well said the other 0
it rather depends what 0
sort of person you 0
Well for instance said 0
Syme he could never 0
convert that person and 0
he pointed straight in 0
They had come to 0
an open space of 0
sunlight which seemed to 0
express to Syme the 0
final return of his 0
and in the middle 0
of this forest clearing 0
was a figure that 0
might well stand for 0
that common sense in 0
an almost awful actuality 0
Burnt by the sun 0
and stained with perspiration 0
and grave with the 0
bottomless gravity of small 0
necessary toils a heavy 0
French peasant was cutting 0
wood with a hatchet 0
His cart stood a 0
few yards off already 0
half full of timber 0
and the horse that 0
cropped the grass was 0
like his master valorous 0
like his master he 0
was even prosperous but 0
yet was almost sad 0
The man was a 0
Norman taller than the 0
average of the French 0
and his swarthy figure 0
stood dark against a 0
square of sunlight almost 0
like some allegoric figure 0
of labour frescoed on 0
a ground of gold 0
Mr Syme is saying 0
called out Ratcliffe to 0
the French Colonel that 0
this man at least 0
will never be an 0
Mr Syme is right 0
enough there answered Colonel 0
Ducroix laughing if only 0
for the reason that 0
he has plenty of 0
But I forgot that 0
in your country you 0
are not used to 0
He looks poor said 0
Quite so said the 0
that is why he 0
I have an idea 0
how much would he 0
take to give us 0
a lift in his 0
Those dogs are all 0
on foot and we 0
could soon leave them 0
Oh give him anything 0
I have piles of 0
That will never do 0
he will never have 0
any respect for you 0
unless you drive a 0
Oh if he haggles 0
Erie haggles because he 0
is a free man 0
You do not understand 0
he would not see 0
the meaning of generosity 0
He is not being 0
And even while they 0
seemed to hear the 0
heavy feet of their 0
strange pursuers behind them 0
they had to stand 0
and stamp while the 0
French Colonel talked to 0
the French wood cutter 0
with all the leisurely 0
badinage and bickering of 0
At the end of 0
the four minutes however 0
they saw that the 0
Colonel was right for 0
the wood cutter entered 0
into their plans not 0
with the vague servility 0
of a tout too 0
well paid but with 0
the seriousness of a 0
solicitor who had been 0
paid the proper fee 0
He told them that 0
the best thing they 0
could do was to 0
make their way down 0
to the little inn 0
on the hills above 0
Lancy where the innkeeper 0
an old soldier who 0
had become devot in 0
his latter years would 0
be certain to sympathise 0
with them and even 0
to take risks in 0
The whole company therefore 0
piled themselves on top 0
of the stacks of 0
wood and went rocking 0
in the rude cart 0
down the other and 0
steeper side of the 0
Heavy and ramshackle as 0
was the vehicle it 0
was driven quickly enough 0
and they soon had 0
the exhilarating impression of 0
distancing altogether those whoever 0
they were who were 0
For after all the 0
riddle as to where 0
the anarchists had got 0
all these followers was 0
One man s presence 0
had sufficed for them 0
they had fled at 0
the first sight of 0
the deformed smile of 0
Syme every now and 0
then looked back over 0
his shoulder at the 0
army on their track 0
As the wood grew 0
first thinner and then 0
smaller with distance he 0
could see the sunlit 0
slopes beyond it and 0
and across these was 0
still moving the square 0
black mob like one 0
In the very strong 0
sunlight and with his 0
own very strong eyes 0
which were almost telescopic 0
Syme could see this 0
mass of men quite 0
He could see them 0
as separate human figures 0
but he was increasingly 0
surprised by the way 0
in which they moved 0
They seemed to be 0
dressed in dark clothes 0
and plain hats like 0
any common crowd out 0
but they did not 0
spread and sprawl and 0
trail by various lines 0
to the attack as 0
would be natural in 0
They moved with a 0
sort of dreadful and 0
wicked woodenness like a 0
staring army of automatons 0
Syme pointed this out 0
Yes replied the policeman 0
He is perhaps five 0
hundred miles off but 0
the fear of him 0
is on all of 0
them like the finger 0
Yes they are walking 0
and you bet your 0
boots that they are 0
talking regularly yes and 0
But the one important 0
thing for us is 0
that they are disappearing 0
It was true that 0
the black patch of 0
the pursuing men was 0
growing smaller and smaller 0
as the peasant belaboured 0
The level of the 0
sunlit landscape though flat 0
as a whole fell 0
away on the farther 0
side of the wood 0
in billows of heavy 0
slope towards the sea 0
in a way not 0
unlike the lower slopes 0
of the Sussex downs 0
The only difference was 0
that in Sussex the 0
road would have been 0
broken and angular like 0
a little brook but 0
here the white French 0
road fell sheer in 0
front of them like 0
Down this direct descent 0
the cart clattered at 0
a considerable angle and 0
in a few minutes 0
the road growing yet 0
steeper they saw below 0
them the little harbour 0
of Lancy and a 0
great blue arc of 0
The travelling cloud of 0
their enemies had wholly 0
disappeared from the horizon 0
The horse and cart 0
took a sharp turn 0
round a clump of 0
elms and the horse 0
s nose nearly struck 0
the face of an 0
old gentleman who was 0
sitting on the benches 0
outside the little cafe 0
of Le Soleil d 0
The peasant grunted an 0
apology and got down 0
The others also descended 0
one by one and 0
spoke to the old 0
gentleman with fragmentary phrases 0
of courtesy for it 0
was quite evident from 0
his expansive manner that 0
he was the owner 0
of the little tavern 0
He was a white 0
haired apple faced old 0
boy with sleepy eyes 0
and a grey moustache 0
stout sedentary and very 0
innocent of a type 0
that may often be 0
found in France but 0
is still commoner in 0
Everything about him his 0
pipe his pot of 0
beer his flowers and 0
his beehive suggested an 0
only when his visitors 0
looked up as they 0
entered the inn parlour 0
they saw the sword 0
The Colonel who greeted 0
the innkeeper as an 0
old friend passed rapidly 0
into the inn parlour 0
and sat down ordering 0
The military decision of 0
his action interested Syme 0
who sat next to 0
him and he took 0
the opportunity when the 0
old innkeeper had gone 0
out of satisfying his 0
May I ask you 0
Colonel he said in 0
a low voice why 0
we have come here 0
Colonel Ducroix smiled behind 0
his bristly white moustache 0
For two reasons sir 0
and I will give 0
first not the most 0
important but the most 0
We came here because 0
this is the only 0
place within twenty miles 0
in which we can 0
repeated Syme looking up 0
Yes replied the other 0
if you people are 0
really to distance your 0
enemies it is horses 0
or nothing for you 0
unless of course you 0
have bicycles and motor 0
cars in your pocket 0
And where do you 0
advise us to make 0
Beyond question replied the 0
Colonel you had better 0
make all haste to 0
the police station beyond 0
My friend whom I 0
seconded under somewhat deceptive 0
circumstances seems to me 0
to exaggerate very much 0
the possibilities of a 0
but even he would 0
hardly maintain I suppose 0
that you were not 0
safe with the gendarmes 0
then he said abruptly 0
And your other reason 0
My other reason for 0
coming here said Ducroix 0
soberly is that it 0
is just as well 0
to see a good 0
man or two when 0
one is possibly near 0
Syme looked up at 0
the wall and saw 0
a crudely painted and 0
You are right and 0
then almost immediately afterwards 0
Has anyone seen about 0
Yes answered Ducroix you 0
may be quite certain 0
that I gave orders 0
the moment I came 0
Those enemies of yours 0
gave no impression of 0
hurry but they were 0
really moving wonderfully fast 0
like a well trained 0
I had no idea 0
that the anarchists had 0
You have not a 0
Almost as he spoke 0
the old innkeeper with 0
the blue eyes and 0
white hair came ambling 0
into the room and 0
announced that six horses 0
By Ducroix s advice 0
the five others equipped 0
themselves with some portable 0
form of food and 0
wine and keeping their 0
duelling swords as the 0
only weapons available they 0
clattered away down the 0
The two servants who 0
had carried the Marquis 0
s luggage when he 0
was a marquis were 0
left behind to drink 0
at the cafe by 0
common consent and not 0
at all against their 0
By this time the 0
afternoon sun was slanting 0
westward and by its 0
rays Syme could see 0
the sturdy figure of 0
the old innkeeper growing 0
smaller and smaller but 0
still standing and looking 0
after them quite silently 0
the sunshine in his 0
Syme had a fixed 0
superstitious fancy left in 0
his mind by the 0
chance phrase of the 0
Colonel that this was 0
indeed perhaps the last 0
honest stranger whom he 0
should ever see upon 0
He was still looking 0
at this dwindling figure 0
which stood as a 0
mere grey blot touched 0
with a white flame 0
against the great green 0
wall of the steep 0
And as he stared 0
over the top of 0
the down behind the 0
innkeeper there appeared an 0
army of black clad 0
They seemed to hang 0
above the good man 0
and his house like 0
a black cloud of 0
The horses had been 0
saddled none too soon 0
CHAPTER XII THE EARTH 0
URGING the horses to 0
a gallop without respect 0
to the rather rugged 0
descent of the road 0
the horsemen soon regained 0
their advantage over the 0
men on the march 0
and at last the 0
bulk of the first 0
buildings of Lancy cut 0
off the sight of 0
Nevertheless the ride had 0
been a long one 0
and by the time 0
they reached the real 0
town the west was 0
warming with the colour 0
and quality of sunset 0
The Colonel suggested that 0
before making finally for 0
the police station they 0
should make the effort 0
in passing to attach 0
to themselves one more 0
individual who might be 0
Four out of the 0
five rich men in 0
this town he said 0
I suppose the proportion 0
is pretty equal all 0
The fifth is a 0
friend of mine and 0
a very fine fellow 0
and what is even 0
more important from our 0
point of view he 0
owns a motor car 0
I am afraid said 0
the Professor in his 0
mirthful way looking back 0
along the white road 0
on which the black 0
crawling patch might appear 0
at any moment I 0
am afraid we have 0
hardly time for afternoon 0
Doctor Renard s house 0
is only three minutes 0
off said the Colonel 0
Our danger said Dr 0
Bull is not two 0
Yes said Syme if 0
we ride on fast 0
we must leave them 0
behind for they are 0
He has a motor 0
car said the Colonel 0
But we may not 0
get it said Bull 0
Yes he is quite 0
But he might be 0
Hold your tongue said 0
What is that noise 0
For a second they 0
all sat as still 0
as equestrian statues and 0
for a second for 0
two or three or 0
four seconds heaven and 0
earth seemed equally still 0
Then all their ears 0
in an agony of 0
attention heard along the 0
road that indescribable thrill 0
and throb that means 0
only one thing horses 0
The Colonel s face 0
had an instantaneous change 0
as if lightning had 0
struck it and yet 0
They have done us 0
he said with brief 0
Prepare to receive cavalry 0
Where can they have 0
asked Syme as he 0
mechanically urged his steed 0
The Colonel was silent 0
for a little then 0
he said in a 0
I was speaking with 0
strict accuracy when I 0
said that the Soleil 0
d Or was the 0
only place where one 0
can get horses within 0
said Syme violently I 0
don t believe he 0
Not with all that 0
He may have been 0
forced said the Colonel 0
They must be at 0
least a hundred strong 0
for which reason we 0
are all going to 0
see my friend Renard 0
who has a motor 0
With these words he 0
swung his horse suddenly 0
round a street corner 0
and went down the 0
street with such thundering 0
speed that the others 0
though already well at 0
the gallop had difficulty 0
in following the flying 0
tail of his horse 0
Renard inhabited a high 0
and comfortable house at 0
the top of a 0
steep street so that 0
when the riders alighted 0
at his door they 0
could once more see 0
the solid green ridge 0
of the hill with 0
the white road across 0
it standing up above 0
all the roofs of 0
They breathed again to 0
see that the road 0
as yet was clear 0
and they rang the 0
Renard was a beaming 0
brown bearded man a 0
good example of that 0
silent but very busy 0
professional class which France 0
has preserved even more 0
When the matter was 0
explained to him he 0
pooh poohed the panic 0
of the ex Marquis 0
he said with the 0
solid French scepticism that 0
there was no conceivable 0
probability of a general 0
Anarchy he said shrugging 0
his shoulders it is 0
Et ca cried out 0
the Colonel suddenly pointing 0
over the other s 0
shoulder and that is 0
childishness isn t it 0
They all looked round 0
and saw a curve 0
of black cavalry come 0
sweeping over the top 0
of the hill with 0
all the energy of 0
Swiftly as they rode 0
however the whole rank 0
still kept well together 0
and they could see 0
the black vizards of 0
the first line as 0
level as a line 0
But although the main 0
black square was the 0
same though travelling faster 0
there was now one 0
sensational difference which they 0
could see clearly upon 0
the slope of the 0
hill as if upon 0
The bulk of the 0
riders were in one 0
but one rider flew 0
far ahead of the 0
column and with frantic 0
movements of hand and 0
heel urged his horse 0
faster and faster so 0
that one might have 0
fancied that he was 0
not the pursuer but 0
But even at that 0
great distance they could 0
see something so fanatical 0
so unquestionable in his 0
figure that they knew 0
it was the Secretary 0
I am sorry to 0
cut short a cultured 0
discussion said the Colonel 0
but can you lend 0
me your motor car 0
now in two minutes 0
I have a suspicion 0
that you are all 0
but God forbid that 0
madness should in any 0
Let us go round 0
Renard was a mild 0
man with monstrous wealth 0
his rooms were like 0
the Musee de Cluny 0
and he had three 0
These however he seemed 0
to use very sparingly 0
having the simple tastes 0
of the French middle 0
class and when his 0
impatient friends came to 0
examine them it took 0
them some time to 0
assure themselves that one 0
of them even could 0
be made to work 0
This with some difficulty 0
they brought round into 0
the street before the 0
When they came out 0
of the dim garage 0
they were startled to 0
find that twilight had 0
already fallen with the 0
abruptness of night in 0
Either they had been 0
longer in the place 0
than they imagined or 0
some unusual canopy of 0
cloud had gathered over 0
They looked down the 0
steep streets and seemed 0
to see a slight 0
mist coming up from 0
It is now or 0
No corrected the Professor 0
And as they listened 0
it was evident that 0
the noise rapidly coming 0
nearer on the rattling 0
stones was not the 0
noise of the whole 0
cavalcade but that of 0
the one horseman who 0
had left it far 0
behind the insane Secretary 0
Syme s family like 0
most of those who 0
end in the simple 0
life had once owned 0
a motor and he 0
knew all about them 0
He had leapt at 0
once into the chauffeur 0
s seat and with 0
flushed face was wrenching 0
and tugging at the 0
He bent his strength 0
upon one handle and 0
then said quite quietly 0
I am afraid it 0
As he spoke there 0
swept round the corner 0
a man rigid on 0
his rushing horse with 0
the rush and rigidity 0
He had a smile 0
that thrust out his 0
chin as if it 0
He swept alongside of 0
the stationary car into 0
which its company had 0
crowded and laid his 0
hand on the front 0
It was the Secretary 0
and his mouth went 0
quite straight in the 0
Syme was leaning hard 0
upon the steering wheel 0
and there was no 0
sound but the rumble 0
of the other pursuers 0
riding into the town 0
Then there came quite 0
suddenly a scream of 0
scraping iron and the 0
It plucked the Secretary 0
clean out of his 0
saddle as a knife 0
is whipped out of 0
its sheath trailed him 0
kicking terribly for twenty 0
yards and left him 0
flung flat upon the 0
road far in front 0
of his frightened horse 0
As the car took 0
the corner of the 0
street with a splendid 0
curve they could just 0
see the other anarchists 0
filling the street and 0
raising their fallen leader 0
I can t understand 0
why it has grown 0
so dark said the 0
Professor at last in 0
Going to be a 0
storm I think said 0
I say it s 0
a pity we haven 0
t got a light 0
on this car if 0
only to see by 0
We have said the 0
Colonel and from the 0
floor of the car 0
he fished up a 0
heavy old fashioned carved 0
iron lantern with a 0
It was obviously an 0
antique and it would 0
seem as if its 0
original use had been 0
in some way semi 0
religious for there was 0
a rude moulding of 0
a cross upon one 0
Where on earth did 0
I got it where 0
I got the car 0
answered the Colonel chuckling 0
from my best friend 0
While our friend here 0
was fighting with the 0
steering wheel I ran 0
up the front steps 0
of the house and 0
spoke to Renard who 0
was standing in his 0
own porch you will 0
I suppose I said 0
there s no time 0
to get a lamp 0
He looked up blinking 0
amiably at the beautiful 0
arched ceiling of his 0
From this was suspended 0
by chains of exquisite 0
ironwork this lantern one 0
of the hundred treasures 0
of his treasure house 0
By sheer force he 0
tore the lamp out 0
of his own ceiling 0
shattering the painted panels 0
and bringing down two 0
blue vases with his 0
Then he handed me 0
the iron lantern and 0
I put it in 0
Was I not right 0
when I said that 0
Renard was worth knowing 0
You were said Syme 0
seriously and hung the 0
heavy lantern over the 0
There was a certain 0
allegory of their whole 0
position in the contrast 0
between the modern automobile 0
and its strange ecclesiastical 0
Hitherto they had passed 0
through the quietest part 0
of the town meeting 0
at most one or 0
two pedestrians who could 0
give them no hint 0
of the peace or 0
the hostility of the 0
Now however the windows 0
in the houses began 0
one by one to 0
be lit up giving 0
a greater sense of 0
Bull turned to the 0
new detective who had 0
led their flight and 0
permitted himself one of 0
his natural and friendly 0
These lights make one 0
Inspector Ratcliffe drew his 0
There is only one 0
set of lights that 0
make me more cheerful 0
he said and they 0
are those lights of 0
the police station which 0
I can see beyond 0
Please God we may 0
be there in ten 0
Then all Bull s 0
boiling good sense and 0
optimism broke suddenly out 0
Oh this is all 0
If you really think 0
that ordinary people in 0
ordinary houses are anarchists 0
you must be madder 0
than an anarchist yourself 0
If we turned and 0
fought these fellows the 0
whole town would fight 0
No said the other 0
with an immovable simplicity 0
the whole town would 0
While they were speaking 0
the Professor had leant 0
forward with sudden excitement 0
What is that noise 0
Oh the horses behind 0
us I suppose said 0
I thought we had 0
got clear of them 0
The horses behind us 0
No said the Professor 0
it is not horses 0
and it is not 0
Almost as he spoke 0
across the end of 0
the street before them 0
two shining and rattling 0
They were gone almost 0
in a flash but 0
everyone could see that 0
they were motor cars 0
and the Professor stood 0
up with a pale 0
face and swore that 0
they were the other 0
two motor cars from 0
I tell you they 0
were his he repeated 0
with wild eyes and 0
they were full of 0
said the Colonel angrily 0
Renard would never give 0
He may have been 0
forced said Ratcliffe quietly 0
The whole town is 0
You still believe that 0
asked the Colonel incredulously 0
You will all believe 0
it soon said the 0
other with a hopeless 0
There was a puzzled 0
pause for some little 0
time and then the 0
Colonel began again abruptly 0
No I can t 0
The thing is nonsense 0
The plain people of 0
a peaceable French town 0
He was cut short 0
by a bang and 0
a blaze of light 0
which seemed close to 0
As the car sped 0
on it left a 0
floating patch of white 0
smoke behind it and 0
Syme had heard a 0
shot shriek past his 0
said the Colonel someone 0
has shot at us 0
It need not interrupt 0
conversation said the gloomy 0
Pray resume your remarks 0
You were talking I 0
think about the plain 0
people of a peaceable 0
The staring Colonel was 0
long past minding satire 0
He rolled his eyes 0
all round the street 0
It is extraordinary he 0
A fastidious person said 0
Syme might even call 0
However I suppose those 0
lights out in the 0
field beyond this street 0
We shall soon get 0
No said Inspector Ratcliffe 0
we shall never get 0
He had been standing 0
up and looking keenly 0
Now he sat down 0
and smoothed his sleek 0
hair with a weary 0
What do you mean 0
I mean that we 0
shall never get there 0
said the pessimist placidly 0
They have two rows 0
of armed men across 0
I can see them 0
The town is in 0
arms as I said 0
I can only wallow 0
in the exquisite comfort 0
of my own exactitude 0
And Ratcliffe sat down 0
comfortably in the car 0
and lit a cigarette 0
but the others rose 0
excitedly and stared down 0
Syme had slowed down 0
the car as their 0
plans became doubtful and 0
he brought it finally 0
to a standstill just 0
at the corner of 0
a side street that 0
ran down very steeply 0
The town was mostly 0
in shadow but the 0
sun had not sunk 0
wherever its level light 0
could break through it 0
painted everything a burning 0
Up this side street 0
the last sunset light 0
shone as sharp and 0
narrow as the shaft 0
of artificial light at 0
It struck the car 0
of the five friends 0
and lit it like 0
But the rest of 0
the street especially the 0
two ends of it 0
was in the deepest 0
twilight and for some 0
seconds they could see 0
Then Syme whose eyes 0
were the keenest broke 0
into a little bitter 0
It is quite true 0
There is a crowd 0
or an army or 0
some such thing across 0
the end of that 0
Well if there is 0
said Bull impatiently it 0
must be something else 0
a sham fight or 0
the mayor s birthday 0
I cannot and will 0
not believe that plain 0
jolly people in a 0
place like this walk 0
about with dynamite in 0
Get on a bit 0
Syme and let us 0
The car crawled about 0
a hundred yards farther 0
and then they were 0
all startled by Dr 0
Bull breaking into a 0
high crow of laughter 0
Why you silly mugs 0
he cried what did 0
That crowd s as 0
law abiding as a 0
cow and if it 0
weren t it s 0
How do you know 0
asked the professor staring 0
You blind bat cried 0
Bull don t you 0
see who is leading 0
They peered again and 0
then the Colonel with 0
a catch in his 0
Why it s Renard 0
There was indeed a 0
rank of dim figures 0
running across the road 0
and they could not 0
but far enough in 0
front to catch the 0
accident of the evening 0
light was stalking up 0
and down the unmistakable 0
Renard in a white 0
hat stroking his long 0
brown beard and holding 0
a revolver in his 0
What a fool I 0
Of course the dear 0
old boy has turned 0
out to help us 0
Bull was bubbling over 0
with laughter swinging the 0
sword in his hand 0
as carelessly as a 0
He jumped out of 0
the car and ran 0
across the intervening space 0
An instant after Syme 0
thought his own eyes 0
had gone mad in 0
For the philanthropic Dr 0
Renard had deliberately raised 0
his revolver and fired 0
twice at Bull so 0
that the shots rang 0
Almost at the same 0
second as the puff 0
of white cloud went 0
up from this atrocious 0
explosion a long puff 0
of white cloud went 0
up also from the 0
cigarette of the cynical 0
Like all the rest 0
he turned a little 0
pale but he smiled 0
Bull at whom the 0
bullets had been fired 0
just missing his scalp 0
stood quite still in 0
the middle of the 0
road without a sign 0
of fear and then 0
turned very slowly and 0
crawled back to the 0
car and climbed in 0
with two holes through 0
Well said the cigarette 0
smoker slowly what do 0
I think said Dr 0
Bull with precision that 0
I am lying in 0
217 Peabody Buildings and 0
that I shall soon 0
wake up with a 0
or if that s 0
not it I think 0
that I am sitting 0
in a small cushioned 0
cell in Hanwell and 0
that the doctor can 0
t make much of 0
But if you want 0
to know what I 0
don t think I 0
I don t think 0
I don t think 0
and I never shall 0
think that the mass 0
of ordinary men are 0
a pack of dirty 0
No sir I m 0
a democrat and I 0
still don t believe 0
that Sunday could convert 0
one average navvy or 0
No I may be 0
mad but humanity isn 0
Syme turned his bright 0
blue eyes on Bull 0
with an earnestness which 0
he did not commonly 0
You are a very 0
fine fellow he said 0
You can believe in 0
a sanity which is 0
not merely your sanity 0
And you re right 0
enough about humanity about 0
peasants and people like 0
that jolly old innkeeper 0
But you re not 0
I suspected him from 0
He s rationalistic and 0
what s worse he 0
When duty and religion 0
are really destroyed it 0
will be by the 0
They are really destroyed 0
now said the man 0
with a cigarette and 0
rose with his hands 0
The devils are coming 0
The men in the 0
motor car looked anxiously 0
in the direction of 0
his dreamy gaze and 0
they saw that the 0
whole regiment at the 0
end of the road 0
was advancing upon them 0
Renard marching furiously in 0
front his beard flying 0
The Colonel sprang out 0
of the car with 0
Gentlemen he cried the 0
It must be a 0
If you knew Renard 0
as I do it 0
s like calling Queen 0
If you had got 0
the man s character 0
Bull said Syme sardonically 0
has at least got 0
it into his hat 0
I tell you it 0
cried the Colonel stamping 0
Renard shall explain it 0
He shall explain it 0
to me and he 0
Don t be in 0
such a hurry drawled 0
He will very soon 0
explain it to all 0
But the impatient Colonel 0
was already out of 0
earshot advancing towards the 0
Renard lifted his pistol 0
again but perceiving his 0
opponent hesitated and the 0
Colonel came face to 0
face with him with 0
frantic gestures of remonstrance 0
It is no good 0
He will never get 0
anything out of that 0
I vote we drive 0
bang through the thick 0
of them bang as 0
the bullets went through 0
We may all be 0
killed but we must 0
kill a tidy number 0
I won t ave 0
Bull growing more vulgar 0
in the sincerity of 0
The poor chaps may 0
be making a mistake 0
Give the Colonel a 0
Shall we go back 0
No said Ratcliffe in 0
a cold voice the 0
street behind us is 0
In fact I seem 0
to see there another 0
friend of yours Syme 0
Syme spun round smartly 0
and stared backwards at 0
the track which they 0
He saw an irregular 0
body of horsemen gathering 0
and galloping towards them 0
He saw above the 0
foremost saddle the silver 0
gleam of a sword 0
and then as it 0
grew nearer the silver 0
gleam of an old 0
The next moment with 0
shattering violence he had 0
swung the motor round 0
and sent it dashing 0
down the steep side 0
street to the sea 0
like a man that 0
desired only to die 0
What the devil is 0
cried the Professor seizing 0
The morning star has 0
said Syme as his 0
own car went down 0
the darkness like a 0
The others did not 0
understand his words but 0
when they looked back 0
at the street above 0
they saw the hostile 0
cavalry coming round the 0
corner and down the 0
and foremost of all 0
rode the good innkeeper 0
flushed with the fiery 0
innocence of the evening 0
The world is insane 0
said the Professor and 0
buried his face in 0
Bull in adamantine humility 0
What are we going 0
At this moment said 0
Syme with a scientific 0
detachment I think we 0
are going to smash 0
The next instant the 0
automobile had come with 0
a catastrophic jar against 0
The instant after that 0
four men had crawled 0
out from under a 0
chaos of metal and 0
a tall lean lamp 0
post that had stood 0
up straight on the 0
edge of the marine 0
parade stood out bent 0
and twisted like the 0
branch of a broken 0
Well we smashed something 0
said the Professor with 0
That s some comfort 0
You re becoming an 0
anarchist said Syme dusting 0
his clothes with his 0
Everyone is said Ratcliffe 0
As they spoke the 0
white haired horseman and 0
his followers came thundering 0
from above and almost 0
at the same moment 0
a dark string of 0
men ran shouting along 0
Syme snatched a sword 0
and took it in 0
he stuck two others 0
under his arm pits 0
took a fourth in 0
his left hand and 0
the lantern in his 0
right and leapt off 0
the high parade on 0
to the beach below 0
The others leapt after 0
him with a common 0
acceptance of such decisive 0
action leaving the debris 0
and the gathering mob 0
We have one more 0
chance said Syme taking 0
the steel out of 0
Whatever all this pandemonium 0
means I suppose the 0
police station will help 0
We can t get 0
there for they hold 0
But there s a 0
pier or breakwater runs 0
out into the sea 0
just here which we 0
could defend longer than 0
anything else like Horatius 0
We must defend it 0
till the Gendarmerie turn 0
They followed him as 0
he went crunching down 0
the beach and in 0
a second or two 0
their boots broke not 0
on the sea gravel 0
but on broad flat 0
They marched down a 0
long low jetty running 0
out in one arm 0
into the dim boiling 0
sea and when they 0
came to the end 0
of it they felt 0
that they had come 0
to the end of 0
They turned and faced 0
That town was transfigured 0
All along the high 0
parade from which they 0
had just descended was 0
a dark and roaring 0
stream of humanity with 0
tossing arms and fiery 0
faces groping and glaring 0
The long dark line 0
was dotted with torches 0
but even where no 0
flame lit up a 0
furious face they could 0
see in the farthest 0
figure in the most 0
shadowy gesture an organised 0
It was clear that 0
they were the accursed 0
of all men and 0
they knew not why 0
Two or three men 0
looking little and black 0
like monkeys leapt over 0
the edge as they 0
had done and dropped 0
on to the beach 0
These came ploughing down 0
the deep sand shouting 0
horribly and strove to 0
wade into the sea 0
The example was followed 0
and the whole black 0
mass of men began 0
to run and drip 0
over the edge like 0
Foremost among the men 0
on the beach Syme 0
saw the peasant who 0
had driven their cart 0
He splashed into the 0
surf on a huge 0
cart horse and shook 0
his axe at them 0
They have not risen 0
since the Middle Ages 0
Even if the police 0
do come now said 0
the Professor mournfully they 0
can do nothing with 0
there must be some 0
people left in the 0
town who are human 0
No said the hopeless 0
Inspector the human being 0
will soon be extinct 0
We are the last 0
It may be said 0
Then he added in 0
his dreamy voice What 0
is all that at 0
the end of the 0
nor private dares to 0
Nor human light is 0
left nor glimpse divine 0
thy dread Empire Chaos 0
Light dies before thine 0
uncreating word Thy hand 0
great Anarch lets the 0
And universal darkness buries 0
cried Bull suddenly the 0
The low lights of 0
the police station were 0
indeed blotted and broken 0
with hurrying figures and 0
they heard through the 0
darkness the clash and 0
jingle of a disciplined 0
They are charging the 0
cried Bull in ecstacy 0
No said Syme they 0
are formed along the 0
They have unslung their 0
carbines cried Bull dancing 0
Yes said Ratcliffe and 0
they are going to 0
As he spoke there 0
came a long crackle 0
of musketry and bullets 0
seemed to hop like 0
hailstones on the stones 0
in front of them 0
The gendarmes have joined 0
cried the Professor and 0
I am in the 0
padded cell said Bull 0
There was a long 0
silence and then Ratcliffe 0
said looking out over 0
the swollen sea all 0
a sort of grey 0
What does it matter 0
who is mad or 0
We shall all be 0
Syme turned to him 0
You are quite hopeless 0
Mr Ratcliffe kept a 0
then at last he 0
oddly enough I am 0
There is one insane 0
little hope that I 0
cannot get out of 0
The power of this 0
whole planet is against 0
us yet I cannot 0
help wondering whether this 0
one silly little hope 0
In what or whom 0
asked Syme with curiosity 0
In a man I 0
never saw said the 0
other looking at the 0
I know what you 0
mean said Syme in 0
a low voice the 0
man in the dark 0
But Sunday must have 0
killed him by now 0
Perhaps said the other 0
but if so he 0
was the only man 0
whom Sunday found it 0
I heard what you 0
said said the Professor 0
with his back turned 0
I also am holding 0
hard on to the 0
thing I never saw 0
All of a sudden 0
Syme who was standing 0
as if blind with 0
introspective thought swung round 0
and cried out like 0
a man waking from 0
Where is the Colonel 0
I thought he was 0
Yes cried Bull where 0
on earth is the 0
He went to speak 0
to Renard said the 0
We cannot leave him 0
among all those beasts 0
Let us die like 0
Do not pity the 0
Colonel said Ratcliffe with 0
He is extremely comfortable 0
cried Syme in a 0
kind of frenzy not 0
I will never believe 0
Will you believe your 0
asked the other and 0
pointed to the beach 0
Many of their pursuers 0
had waded into the 0
water shaking their fists 0
but the sea was 0
rough and they could 0
not reach the pier 0
Two or three figures 0
however stood on the 0
beginning of the stone 0
footway and seemed to 0
be cautiously advancing down 0
The glare of a 0
chance lantern lit up 0
the faces of the 0
One face wore a 0
black half mask and 0
under it the mouth 0
was twisting about in 0
such a madness of 0
nerves that the black 0
tuft of beard wriggled 0
round and round like 0
a restless living thing 0
The other was the 0
red face and white 0
moustache of Colonel Ducroix 0
They were in earnest 0
Yes he is gone 0
too said the Professor 0
and sat down on 0
I can t trust 0
my own bodily machinery 0
I feel as if 0
my own hand might 0
fly up and strike 0
When my hand flies 0
up said Syme it 0
will strike somebody else 0
and he strode along 0
the pier towards the 0
Colonel the sword in 0
one hand and the 0
lantern in the other 0
As if to destroy 0
the last hope or 0
doubt the Colonel who 0
saw him coming pointed 0
his revolver at him 0
The shot missed Syme 0
but struck his sword 0
breaking it short at 0
Syme rushed on and 0
swung the iron lantern 0
he said and struck 0
the Colonel down upon 0
Then he turned to 0
the Secretary whose frightful 0
mouth was almost foaming 0
now and held the 0
lamp high with so 0
rigid and arresting a 0
gesture that the man 0
was as it were 0
frozen for a moment 0
and forced to hear 0
Do you see this 0
cried Syme in a 0
Do you see the 0
cross carved on it 0
and the flame inside 0
You did not make 0
You did not light 0
it Better men than 0
you men who could 0
believe and obey twisted 0
the entrails of iron 0
and preserved the legend 0
There is not a 0
street you walk on 0
there is not a 0
thread you wear that 0
was not made as 0
this lantern was by 0
denying your philosophy of 0
You can make nothing 0
You can only destroy 0
You will destroy mankind 0
you will destroy the 0
Let that suffice you 0
Yet this one old 0
Christian lantern you shall 0
It shall go where 0
your empire of apes 0
will never have the 0
wit to find it 0
He struck the Secretary 0
once with the lantern 0
so that he staggered 0
and then whirling it 0
twice round his head 0
sent it flying far 0
out to sea where 0
it flared like a 0
roaring rocket and fell 0
shouted Syme turning his 0
to the three behind 0
Let us charge these 0
dogs for our time 0
has come to die 0
His three companions came 0
after him sword in 0
Syme s sword was 0
broken but he rent 0
a bludgeon from the 0
fist of a fisherman 0
In a moment they 0
would have flung themselves 0
upon the face of 0
the mob and perished 0
when an interruption came 0
The Secretary ever since 0
Syme s speech had 0
stood with his hand 0
to his stricken head 0
now he suddenly pulled 0
off his black mask 0
The pale face thus 0
peeled in the lamplight 0
revealed not so much 0
He put up his 0
hand with an anxious 0
There is some mistake 0
Mr Syme I hardly 0
think you understand your 0
I arrest you in 0
the name of the 0
said Syme and dropped 0
I am a detective 0
from Scotland Yard and 0
he took a small 0
blue card from his 0
And what do you 0
asked the Professor and 0
threw up his arms 0
You said the Secretary 0
stiffly are as I 0
know for a fact 0
members of the Supreme 0
Disguised as one of 0
Bull tossed his sword 0
There never was any 0
Supreme Anarchist Council he 0
We were all a 0
lot of silly policemen 0
looking at each other 0
And all these nice 0
people who have been 0
peppering us with shot 0
thought we were the 0
I knew I couldn 0
t be wrong about 0
the mob he said 0
beaming over the enormous 0
multitude which stretched away 0
to the distance on 0
Vulgar people are never 0
I m vulgar myself 0
I am now going 0
on shore to stand 0
a drink to everybody 0
CHAPTER XIII THE PURSUIT 0
NEXT morning five bewildered 0
but hilarious people took 0
the boat for Dover 0
The poor old Colonel 0
might have had some 0
cause to complain having 0
been first forced to 0
fight for two factions 0
that didn t exist 0
and then knocked down 0
with an iron lantern 0
But he was a 0
magnanimous old gentleman and 0
being much relieved that 0
neither party had anything 0
to do with dynamite 0
he saw them off 0
on the pier with 0
The five reconciled detectives 0
had a hundred details 0
to explain to each 0
The Secretary had to 0
tell Syme how they 0
had come to wear 0
masks originally in order 0
to approach the supposed 0
enemy as fellow conspirators 0
Syme had to explain 0
how they had fled 0
with such swiftness through 0
But above all these 0
matters of detail which 0
could be explained rose 0
the central mountain of 0
the matter that they 0
What did it all 0
If they were all 0
harmless officers what was 0
If he had not 0
seized the world what 0
on earth had he 0
Inspector Ratcliffe was still 0
I can t make 0
head or tail of 0
old Sunday s little 0
game any more than 0
you can he said 0
But whatever else Sunday 0
is he isn t 0
do you remember his 0
I grant you answered 0
Syme that I have 0
never been able to 0
Well said the Secretary 0
I suppose we can 0
find out soon for 0
tomorrow we have our 0
You will excuse me 0
he said with a 0
rather ghastly smile for 0
being well acquainted with 0
I suppose you are 0
right said the Professor 0
I suppose we might 0
find it out from 0
but I confess that 0
I should feel a 0
bit afraid of asking 0
Sunday who he really 0
Why asked the Secretary 0
for fear of bombs 0
No said the Professor 0
for fear he might 0
Let us have some 0
Bull after a silence 0
Throughout their whole journey 0
by boat and train 0
they were highly convivial 0
but they instinctively kept 0
Bull who had always 0
been the optimist of 0
the party endeavoured to 0
persuade the other four 0
that the whole company 0
could take the same 0
hansom cab from Victoria 0
but this was over 0
ruled and they went 0
in a four wheeler 0
Bull on the box 0
They finished their journey 0
at an hotel in 0
Piccadilly Circus so as 0
to be close to 0
the early breakfast next 0
morning in Leicester Square 0
Yet even then the 0
adventures of the day 0
were not entirely over 0
Bull discontented with the 0
general proposal to go 0
to bed had strolled 0
out of the hotel 0
at about eleven to 0
see and taste some 0
of the beauties of 0
Twenty minutes afterwards however 0
he came back and 0
made quite a clamour 0
Syme who tried at 0
first to soothe him 0
was forced at last 0
to listen to his 0
communication with quite new 0
I tell you I 0
Bull with thick emphasis 0
Not so bad as 0
Bull with unnecessary laughter 0
not so bad as 0
I ve got him 0
Hairy man said the 0
other lucidly man that 0
used to be hairy 0
Here he is and 0
he pulled forward by 0
a reluctant elbow the 0
identical young man who 0
five days before had 0
marched out of the 0
Council with thin red 0
hair and a pale 0
face the first of 0
all the sham anarchists 0
who had been exposed 0
Why do you worry 0
You have expelled me 0
We are all spies 0
We re all spies 0
Come and have a 0
Next morning the battalion 0
of the reunited six 0
marched stolidly towards the 0
hotel in Leicester Square 0
This is more cheerful 0
we are six men 0
going to ask one 0
man what he means 0
I think it is 0
a bit queerer than 0
I think it is 0
six men going to 0
ask one man what 0
They turned in silence 0
into the Square and 0
though the hotel was 0
in the opposite corner 0
they saw at once 0
the little balcony and 0
a figure that looked 0
too big for it 0
He was sitting alone 0
with bent head poring 0
But all his councillors 0
who had come to 0
vote him down crossed 0
that Square as if 0
they were watched out 0
of heaven by a 0
They had disputed much 0
upon their policy about 0
whether they should leave 0
the unmasked Gogol without 0
and begin diplomatically or 0
whether they should bring 0
him in and blow 0
up the gunpowder at 0
The influence of Syme 0
and Bull prevailed for 0
the latter course though 0
the Secretary to the 0
last asked them why 0
they attacked Sunday so 0
My reason is quite 0
I attack him rashly 0
because I am afraid 0
They followed Syme up 0
the dark stair in 0
silence and they all 0
came out simultaneously into 0
the broad sunlight of 0
the morning and the 0
broad sunlight of Sunday 0
So pleased to see 0
What an exquisite day 0
Is the Czar dead 0
The Secretary who happened 0
to be foremost drew 0
himself together for a 0
No sir he said 0
sternly there has been 0
I bring you news 0
of no such disgusting 0
repeated the President with 0
a bright inquiring smile 0
The Secretary choked for 0
a moment and the 0
President went on with 0
a sort of smooth 0
Of course we all 0
have our opinions and 0
even our eyes but 0
really to call them 0
disgusting before the man 0
Bull tore off his 0
spectacles and broke them 0
My spectacles are blackguardly 0
he said but I 0
Look at my face 0
I dare say it 0
s the sort of 0
face that grows on 0
one said the President 0
in fact it grows 0
and who am I 0
to quarrel with the 0
wild fruits upon the 0
I dare say it 0
will grow on me 0
We have no time 0
for tomfoolery said the 0
Secretary breaking in savagely 0
We have come to 0
know what all this 0
Why did you get 0
Do you know who 0
and what we are 0
Are you a half 0
witted man playing the 0
conspirator or are you 0
a clever man playing 0
Answer me I tell 0
Candidates murmured Sunday are 0
only required to answer 0
eight out of the 0
seventeen questions on the 0
As far as I 0
can make out you 0
want me to tell 0
you what I am 0
and what you are 0
and what this table 0
is and what this 0
Council is and what 0
this world is for 0
Well I will go 0
so far as to 0
rend the veil of 0
If you want to 0
know what you are 0
you are a set 0
of highly well intentioned 0
And you said Syme 0
leaning forward what are 0
roared the President and 0
he rose slowly to 0
an incredible height like 0
some enormous wave about 0
to arch above them 0
You want to know 0
what I am do 0
Bull you are a 0
Grub in the roots 0
of those trees and 0
find out the truth 0
Syme you are a 0
Stare at those morning 0
But I tell you 0
this that you will 0
have found out the 0
truth of the last 0
tree and the top 0
most cloud before the 0
You will understand the 0
sea and I shall 0
be still a riddle 0
you shall know what 0
the stars are and 0
not know what I 0
Since the beginning of 0
the world all men 0
have hunted me like 0
a wolf kings and 0
sages and poets and 0
lawgivers all the churches 0
and all the philosophies 0
But I have never 0
been caught yet and 0
the skies will fall 0
in the time I 0
I have given them 0
a good run for 0
their money and I 0
Before one of them 0
could move the monstrous 0
man had swung himself 0
like some huge ourang 0
outang over the balustrade 0
Yet before he dropped 0
he pulled himself up 0
again as on a 0
horizontal bar and thrusting 0
his great chin over 0
the edge of the 0
There s one thing 0
I ll tell you 0
though about who I 0
I am the man 0
in the dark room 0
who made you all 0
With that he fell 0
from the balcony bouncing 0
on the stones below 0
like a great ball 0
of india rubber and 0
went bounding off towards 0
the corner of the 0
Alhambra where he hailed 0
a hansom cab and 0
The six detectives had 0
been standing thunderstruck and 0
livid in the light 0
of his last assertion 0
but when he disappeared 0
into the cab Syme 0
s practical senses returned 0
to him and leaping 0
over the balcony so 0
recklessly as almost to 0
break his legs he 0
He and Bull sprang 0
into the cab together 0
the Professor and the 0
Inspector into another while 0
the Secretary and the 0
late Gogol scrambled into 0
a third just in 0
time to pursue the 0
flying Syme who was 0
pursuing the flying President 0
Sunday led them a 0
wild chase towards the 0
north west his cabman 0
evidently under the influence 0
of more than common 0
inducements urging the horse 0
But Syme was in 0
no mood for delicacies 0
and he stood up 0
in his own cab 0
until crowds ran along 0
beside his cab and 0
policemen began to stop 0
All this had its 0
influence upon the President 0
s cabman who began 0
to look dubious and 0
to slow down to 0
He opened the trap 0
to talk reasonably to 0
his fare and in 0
so doing let the 0
long whip droop over 0
the front of the 0
Sunday leant forward seized 0
it and jerked it 0
violently out of the 0
Then standing up in 0
front of the cab 0
himself he lashed the 0
horse and roared aloud 0
so that they went 0
down the streets like 0
Through street after street 0
and square after square 0
went whirling this preposterous 0
vehicle in which the 0
fare was urging the 0
horse and the driver 0
trying desperately to stop 0
The other three cabs 0
if the phrase be 0
permissible of a cab 0
Shops and streets shot 0
by like rattling arrows 0
At the highest ecstacy 0
of speed Sunday turned 0
round on the splashboard 0
where he stood and 0
sticking his great grinning 0
head out of the 0
cab with white hair 0
whistling in the wind 0
he made a horrible 0
face at his pursuers 0
like some colossal urchin 0
Then raising his right 0
hand swiftly he flung 0
a ball of paper 0
in Syme s face 0
Syme caught the thing 0
while instinctively warding it 0
off and discovered that 0
it consisted of two 0
One was addressed to 0
himself and the other 0
Bull with a very 0
long and it is 0
to be feared partly 0
ironical string of letters 0
Bull s address was 0
at any rate considerably 0
longer than his communication 0
for the communication consisted 0
entirely of the words 0
What about Martin Tupper 0
What does the old 0
asked Bull staring at 0
What does yours say 0
Syme s message was 0
at any rate longer 0
and ran as follows 0
No one would regret 0
anything in the nature 0
of an interference by 0
the Archdeacon more than 0
I I trust it 0
will not come to 0
But for the last 0
time where are your 0
The thing is too 0
bad especially after what 0
The President s cabman 0
seemed to be regaining 0
some control over his 0
horse and the pursuers 0
gained a little as 0
they swept round into 0
And here there occurred 0
what seemed to the 0
allies a providential stoppage 0
Traffic of every kind 0
was swerving to right 0
or left or stopping 0
for down the long 0
road was coming the 0
unmistakable roar announcing the 0
fire engine which in 0
a few seconds went 0
by like a brazen 0
But quick as it 0
went by Sunday had 0
bounded out of his 0
cab sprung at the 0
fire engine caught it 0
slung himself on to 0
it and was seen 0
as he disappeared in 0
the noisy distance talking 0
to the astonished fireman 0
He can t go 0
There s no mistaking 0
The three cabmen who 0
had been stunned for 0
a moment whipped up 0
their horses and slightly 0
decreased the distance between 0
themselves and their disappearing 0
The President acknowledged this 0
proximity by coming to 0
the back of the 0
car bowing repeatedly kissing 0
his hand and finally 0
flinging a neatly folded 0
note into the bosom 0
When that gentleman opened 0
it not without impatience 0
he found it contained 0
The truth about your 0
trouser stretchers is known 0
The fire engine had 0
struck still farther to 0
the north into a 0
region that they did 0
and as it ran 0
by a line of 0
high railings shadowed with 0
trees the six friends 0
were startled but somewhat 0
relieved to see the 0
President leap from the 0
fire engine though whether 0
through another whim or 0
the increasing protest of 0
his entertainers they could 0
Before the three cabs 0
however could reach up 0
to the spot he 0
had gone up the 0
high railings like a 0
huge grey cat tossed 0
himself over and vanished 0
in a darkness of 0
Syme with a furious 0
gesture stopped his cab 0
jumped out and sprang 0
also to the escalade 0
When he had one 0
leg over the fence 0
and his friends were 0
following he turned a 0
face on them which 0
shone quite pale in 0
What place can this 0
Can it be the 0
old devil s house 0
I ve heard he 0
has a house in 0
All the better said 0
the Secretary grimly planting 0
a foot in a 0
foothold we shall find 0
No but it isn 0
t that said Syme 0
I hear the most 0
horrible noises like devils 0
laughing and sneezing and 0
blowing their devilish noses 0
His dogs barking of 0
course said the Secretary 0
Why not say his 0
said Syme furiously snails 0
Did you ever hear 0
a dog bark like 0
He held up his 0
hand and there came 0
out of the thicket 0
a long growling roar 0
that seemed to get 0
under the skin and 0
freeze the flesh a 0
low thrilling roar that 0
made a throbbing in 0
the air all about 0
The dogs of Sunday 0
would be no ordinary 0
dogs said Gogol and 0
Syme had jumped down 0
on the other side 0
but he still stood 0
Well listen to that 0
he said is that 0
a dog anybody s 0
There broke upon their 0
ear a hoarse screaming 0
as of things protesting 0
and clamouring in sudden 0
and then far off 0
like an echo what 0
sounded like a long 0
Well his house ought 0
and if it is 0
hell I m going 0
and he sprang over 0
the tall railings almost 0
They broke through a 0
tangle of plants and 0
shrubs and came out 0
on an open path 0
Nothing was in sight 0
Bull suddenly struck his 0
Why you asses he 0
cried it s the 0
As they were looking 0
round wildly for any 0
trace of their wild 0
quarry a keeper in 0
uniform came running along 0
the path with a 0
man in plain clothes 0
Has it come this 0
An elephant has gone 0
mad and run away 0
He has run away 0
with an old gentleman 0
said the other stranger 0
breathlessly a poor old 0
gentleman with white hair 0
What sort of old 0
asked Syme with great 0
A very large and 0
fat old gentleman in 0
light grey clothes said 0
Well said Syme if 0
he s that particular 0
kind of old gentleman 0
if you re quite 0
sure that he s 0
a large and fat 0
old gentleman in grey 0
clothes you may take 0
my word for it 0
that the elephant has 0
not run away with 0
He has run away 0
The elephant is not 0
made by God that 0
could run away with 0
him if he did 0
not consent to the 0
And by thunder there 0
There was no doubt 0
about it this time 0
Clean across the space 0
of grass about two 0
hundred yards away with 0
a crowd screaming and 0
scampering vainly at his 0
heels went a huge 0
grey elephant at an 0
awful stride with his 0
trunk thrown out as 0
rigid as a ship 0
s bowsprit and trumpeting 0
like the trumpet of 0
On the back of 0
the bellowing and plunging 0
animal sat President Sunday 0
with all the placidity 0
of a sultan but 0
goading the animal to 0
a furious speed with 0
some sharp object in 0
He ll be out 0
He is out of 0
And even as he 0
spoke a final crash 0
and roar of terror 0
announced that the great 0
grey elephant had broken 0
out of the gates 0
of the Zoological Gardens 0
and was careening down 0
Albany Street like a 0
new and swift sort 0
cried Bull I never 0
knew an elephant could 0
Well it must be 0
hansom cabs again if 0
we are to keep 0
As they raced along 0
to the gate out 0
of which the elephant 0
had vanished Syme felt 0
a glaring panorama of 0
the strange animals in 0
the cages which they 0
Afterwards he thought it 0
queer that he should 0
have seen them so 0
He remembered especially seeing 0
pelicans with their preposterous 0
He wondered why the 0
pelican was the symbol 0
of charity except it 0
was that it wanted 0
a good deal of 0
charity to admire a 0
He remembered a hornbill 0
which was simply a 0
huge yellow beak with 0
a small bird tied 0
The whole gave him 0
a sensation the vividness 0
of which he could 0
not explain that Nature 0
was always making quite 0
Sunday had told them 0
that they would understand 0
him when they had 0
He wondered whether even 0
the archangels understood the 0
The six unhappy detectives 0
flung themselves into cabs 0
and followed the elephant 0
sharing the terror which 0
he spread through the 0
long stretch of the 0
This time Sunday did 0
not turn round but 0
offered them the solid 0
stretch of his unconscious 0
back which maddened them 0
if possible more than 0
Just before they came 0
to Baker Street however 0
he was seen to 0
throw something far up 0
into the air as 0
a boy does a 0
ball meaning to catch 0
But at their rate 0
of racing it fell 0
far behind just by 0
the cab containing Gogol 0
and in faint hope 0
of a clue or 0
for some impulse unexplainable 0
he stopped his cab 0
so as to pick 0
It was addressed to 0
himself and was quite 0
On examination however its 0
bulk was found to 0
consist of thirty three 0
pieces of paper of 0
no value wrapped one 0
When the last covering 0
was torn away it 0
reduced itself to a 0
small slip of paper 0
on which was written 0
The word I fancy 0
The man once known 0
as Gogol said nothing 0
but the movements of 0
his hands and feet 0
were like those of 0
a man urging a 0
horse to renewed efforts 0
Through street after street 0
through district after district 0
went the prodigy of 0
the flying elephant calling 0
crowds to every window 0
and driving the traffic 0
And still through all 0
this insane publicity the 0
three cabs toiled after 0
it until they came 0
to be regarded as 0
part of a procession 0
and perhaps the advertisement 0
They went at such 0
a rate that distances 0
were shortened beyond belief 0
and Syme saw the 0
Albert Hall in Kensington 0
when he thought that 0
he was still in 0
The animal s pace 0
was even more fast 0
and free through the 0
empty aristocratic streets of 0
South Kensington and he 0
finally headed towards that 0
part of the sky 0
line where the enormous 0
Wheel of Earl s 0
Court stood up in 0
The wheel grew larger 0
and larger till it 0
filled heaven like the 0
The beast outstripped the 0
They lost him round 0
several corners and when 0
they came to one 0
of the gates of 0
the Earl s Court 0
Exhibition they found themselves 0
In front of them 0
was an enormous crowd 0
in the midst of 0
it was an enormous 0
elephant heaving and shuddering 0
as such shapeless creatures 0
But the President had 0
Where has he gone 0
asked Syme slipping to 0
Gentleman rushed into the 0
said an official in 0
Then he added in 0
an injured voice Funny 0
Asked me to hold 0
his horse and gave 0
He held out with 0
distaste a piece of 0
folded paper addressed To 0
the Secretary of the 0
The Secretary raging rent 0
it open and found 0
When the herring runs 0
a mile Let the 0
When the herring tries 0
to fly Let the 0
Why the eternal crikey 0
began the Secretary did 0
you let the man 0
Do people commonly come 0
to you Exhibition riding 0
asked the Secretary savagely 0
Look at the captive 0
said Syme and pointed 0
Why the blazes should 0
I look at a 0
What is there queer 0
about a captive balloon 0
Nothing said Syme except 0
that it isn t 0
They all turned their 0
eyes to where the 0
balloon swung and swelled 0
above the Exhibition on 0
a string like a 0
A second afterwards the 0
string came in two 0
just under the car 0
and the balloon broken 0
loose floated away with 0
the freedom of a 0
He s got into 0
and he shook his 0
fists at the sky 0
The balloon borne by 0
some chance wind came 0
right above them and 0
they could see the 0
great white head of 0
the President peering over 0
the side and looking 0
benevolently down on them 0
God bless my soul 0
said the Professor with 0
the elderly manner that 0
he could never disconnect 0
from his bleached beard 0
God bless my soul 0
I seemed to fancy 0
that something fell on 0
the top of my 0
He put up a 0
trembling hand and took 0
from that shelf a 0
piece of twisted paper 0
which he opened absently 0
only to find it 0
inscribed with a true 0
lover s knot and 0
Your beauty has not 0
There was a short 0
silence and then Syme 0
said biting his beard 0
I m not beaten 0
The blasted thing must 0
Let s follow it 0
CHAPTER XIV THE SIX 0
ACROSS green fields and 0
breaking through blooming hedges 0
toiled six draggled detectives 0
about five miles out 0
The optimist of the 0
party had at first 0
proposed that they should 0
follow the balloon across 0
South England in hansom 0
But he was ultimately 0
convinced of the persistent 0
refusal of the balloon 0
to follow the roads 0
and the still more 0
persistent refusal of the 0
cabmen to follow the 0
Consequently the tireless though 0
exasperated travellers broke through 0
black thickets and ploughed 0
through ploughed fields till 0
each was turned into 0
a figure too outrageous 0
to be mistaken for 0
Those green hills of 0
Surrey saw the final 0
collapse and tragedy of 0
the admirable light grey 0
suit in which Syme 0
had set out from 0
His silk hat was 0
broken over his nose 0
by a swinging bough 0
his coat tails were 0
torn to the shoulder 0
by arresting thorns the 0
clay of England was 0
splashed up to his 0
but he still carried 0
his yellow beard forward 0
with a silent and 0
furious determination and his 0
eyes were still fixed 0
on that floating ball 0
of gas which in 0
the full flush of 0
sunset seemed coloured like 0
After all he said 0
it is very beautiful 0
It is singularly and 0
I wish the beastly 0
gas bag would burst 0
Bull I hope it 0
It might hurt the 0
said the vindictive Professor 0
Not as much as 0
I d hurt him 0
if I could get 0
I don t want 0
him hurt somehow said 0
cried the Secretary bitterly 0
Do you believe all 0
that tale about his 0
being our man in 0
Sunday would say he 0
I don t know 0
whether I believe it 0
or not said Dr 0
But it isn t 0
that that I mean 0
I can t wish 0
old Sunday s balloon 0
Well said Syme impatiently 0
Well because he s 0
so jolly like a 0
balloon himself said Dr 0
I don t understand 0
a word of all 0
that idea of his 0
being the same man 0
who gave us all 0
It seems to make 0
But I don t 0
care who knows it 0
I always had a 0
sympathy for old Sunday 0
himself wicked as he 0
Just as if he 0
was a great bouncing 0
How can I explain 0
what my queer sympathy 0
It didn t prevent 0
my fighting him like 0
Shall I make it 0
clear if I say 0
that I liked him 0
because he was so 0
You will not said 0
I ve got it 0
now cried Bull it 0
was because he was 0
so fat and so 0
Just like a balloon 0
We always think of 0
fat people as heavy 0
but he could have 0
danced against a sylph 0
I see now what 0
Moderate strength is shown 0
in violence supreme strength 0
is shown in levity 0
It was like the 0
old speculations what would 0
happen if an elephant 0
could leap up in 0
the sky like a 0
Our elephant said Syme 0
looking upwards has leapt 0
into the sky like 0
And somehow concluded Bull 0
that s why I 0
can t help liking 0
No it s not 0
an admiration of force 0
or any silly thing 0
There is a kind 0
of gaiety in the 0
thing as if he 0
were bursting with some 0
Haven t you sometimes 0
felt it on a 0
You know Nature plays 0
tricks but somehow that 0
day proves they are 0
I never read the 0
Bible myself but that 0
part they laugh at 0
is literal truth Why 0
leap ye ye high 0
The hills do leap 0
at least they try 0
Why do I like 0
how can I tell 0
because he s such 0
There was a long 0
silence and then the 0
Secretary said in a 0
You do not know 0
Perhaps it is because 0
you are better than 0
I and do not 0
I was a fierce 0
fellow and a trifle 0
morbid from the first 0
The man who sits 0
in darkness and who 0
chose us all chose 0
me because I had 0
all the crazy look 0
of a conspirator because 0
my smile went crooked 0
and my eyes were 0
gloomy even when I 0
But there must have 0
been something in me 0
that answered to the 0
nerves in all these 0
For when I first 0
saw Sunday he expressed 0
to me not your 0
airy vitality but something 0
both gross and sad 0
in the Nature of 0
I found him smoking 0
in a twilight room 0
a room with brown 0
blind down infinitely more 0
depressing than the genial 0
darkness in which our 0
He sat there on 0
a bench a huge 0
heap of a man 0
dark and out of 0
He listened to all 0
my words without speaking 0
I poured out my 0
most passionate appeals and 0
asked my most eloquent 0
Then after a long 0
silence the Thing began 0
to shake and I 0
thought it was shaken 0
by some secret malady 0
It shook like a 0
loathsome and living jelly 0
It reminded me of 0
everything I had ever 0
read about the base 0
bodies that are the 0
origin of life the 0
deep sea lumps and 0
It seemed like the 0
final form of matter 0
the most shapeless and 0
I could only tell 0
myself from its shudderings 0
that it was something 0
at least that such 0
a monster could be 0
And then it broke 0
upon me that the 0
bestial mountain was shaking 0
with a lonely laughter 0
and the laughter was 0
Do you ask me 0
to forgive him that 0
It is no small 0
thing to be laughed 0
at by something at 0
once lower and stronger 0
Surely you fellows are 0
exaggerating wildly cut in 0
the clear voice of 0
President Sunday is a 0
terrible fellow for one 0
s intellect but he 0
is not such a 0
Barnum s freak physically 0
as you make out 0
He received me in 0
an ordinary office in 0
a grey check coat 0
He talked to me 0
in an ordinary way 0
But I ll tell 0
you what is a 0
trifle creepy about Sunday 0
His room is neat 0
his clothes are neat 0
everything seems in order 0
but he s absent 0
Sometimes his great bright 0
eyes go quite blind 0
For hours he forgets 0
that you are there 0
Now absent mindedness is 0
just a bit too 0
awful in a bad 0
We think of a 0
wicked man as vigilant 0
We can t think 0
of a wicked man 0
who is honestly and 0
sincerely dreamy because we 0
daren t think of 0
a wicked man alone 0
An absentminded man means 0
a good natured man 0
It means a man 0
who if he happens 0
to see you will 0
But how will you 0
bear an absentminded man 0
who if he happens 0
to see you will 0
That is what tries 0
the nerves abstraction combined 0
Men have felt it 0
sometimes when they went 0
through wild forests and 0
felt that the animals 0
there were at once 0
They might ignore or 0
How would you like 0
to pass ten mortal 0
hours in a parlour 0
with an absent minded 0
And what do you 0
think of Sunday Gogol 0
I don t think 0
of Sunday on principle 0
said Gogol simply any 0
more than I stare 0
at the sun at 0
Well that is a 0
point of view said 0
What do you say 0
The Professor was walking 0
with bent head and 0
trailing stick and he 0
did not answer at 0
Tell us what you 0
The Professor spoke at 0
I think something he 0
said that I cannot 0
Or rather I think 0
something that I cannot 0
But it is something 0
My early life as 0
you know was a 0
bit too large and 0
Well when I saw 0
Sunday s face I 0
thought it was too 0
large everybody does but 0
I also thought it 0
The face was so 0
big that one couldn 0
t focus it or 0
make it a face 0
The eye was so 0
far away from the 0
nose that it wasn 0
The mouth was so 0
much by itself that 0
one had to think 0
of it by itself 0
The whole thing is 0
too hard to explain 0
He paused for a 0
little still trailing his 0
stick and then went 0
But put it this 0
Walking up a road 0
at night I have 0
seen a lamp and 0
a lighted window and 0
a cloud make together 0
a most complete and 0
If anyone in heaven 0
has that face I 0
shall know him again 0
Yet when I walked 0
a little farther I 0
found that there was 0
no face that the 0
window was ten yards 0
away the lamp ten 0
hundred yards the cloud 0
Well Sunday s face 0
it ran away to 0
right and left as 0
such chance pictures run 0
And so his face 0
has made me somehow 0
doubt whether there are 0
I don t know 0
whether your face Bull 0
is a face or 0
a combination in perspective 0
Perhaps one black disc 0
of your beastly glasses 0
is quite close and 0
another fifty miles away 0
Oh the doubts of 0
a materialist are not 0
Sunday has taught me 0
the last and the 0
worst doubts the doubts 0
I am a Buddhist 0
and Buddhism is not 0
a creed it is 0
My poor dear Bull 0
I do not believe 0
that you really have 0
I have not faith 0
enough to believe in 0
Syme s eyes were 0
still fixed upon the 0
errant orb which reddened 0
in the evening light 0
looked like some rosier 0
and more innocent world 0
Have you noticed an 0
odd thing he said 0
about all your descriptions 0
Each man of you 0
finds Sunday quite different 0
yet each man of 0
you can only find 0
one thing to compare 0
him to the universe 0
Bull finds him like 0
the earth in spring 0
Gogol like the sun 0
The Secretary is reminded 0
of the shapeless protoplasm 0
and the Inspector of 0
the carelessness of virgin 0
The Professor says he 0
is like a changing 0
This is queer but 0
it is queerer still 0
that I also have 0
had my odd notion 0
about the President and 0
I also find that 0
I think of Sunday 0
as I think of 0
Get on a little 0
faster Syme said Bull 0
never mind the balloon 0
When I first saw 0
Sunday said Syme slowly 0
I only saw his 0
and when I saw 0
his back I knew 0
he was the worst 0
man in the world 0
His neck and shoulders 0
were brutal like those 0
of some apish god 0
His head had a 0
stoop that was hardly 0
human like the stoop 0
In fact I had 0
at once the revolting 0
fancy that this was 0
not a man at 0
all but a beast 0
dressed up in men 0
Get on said Dr 0
And then the queer 0
I had seen his 0
back from the street 0
as he sat in 0
Then I entered the 0
hotel and coming round 0
the other side of 0
him saw his face 0
His face frightened me 0
as it did everyone 0
but not because it 0
was brutal not because 0
On the contrary it 0
frightened me because it 0
was so beautiful because 0
it was so good 0
Syme exclaimed the Secretary 0
It was like the 0
face of some ancient 0
archangel judging justly after 0
There was laughter in 0
the eyes and in 0
the mouth honour and 0
There was the same 0
white hair the same 0
great grey clad shoulders 0
that I had seen 0
But when I saw 0
him from behind I 0
was certain he was 0
an animal and when 0
I saw him in 0
front I knew he 0
Pan said the Professor 0
dreamily was a god 0
Then and again and 0
always went on Syme 0
like a man talking 0
to himself that has 0
been for me the 0
mystery of Sunday and 0
it is also the 0
mystery of the world 0
When I see the 0
horrible back I am 0
sure the noble face 0
is but a mask 0
When I see the 0
face but for an 0
instant I know the 0
back is only a 0
Bad is so bad 0
that we cannot but 0
think good an accident 0
good is so good 0
that we feel certain 0
that evil could be 0
But the whole came 0
to a kind of 0
crest yesterday when I 0
raced Sunday for the 0
cab and was just 0
behind him all the 0
Had you time for 0
Time replied Syme for 0
I was suddenly possessed 0
with the idea that 0
the blind blank back 0
of his head really 0
was his face an 0
awful eyeless face staring 0
And I fancied that 0
the figure running in 0
front of me was 0
really a figure running 0
backwards and dancing as 0
Horrible is not the 0
It was exactly the 0
worst instant of my 0
And yet ten minutes 0
afterwards when he put 0
his head out of 0
the cab and made 0
a grimace like a 0
gargoyle I knew that 0
he was only like 0
a father playing hide 0
and seek with his 0
It is a long 0
game said the Secretary 0
and frowned at his 0
Listen to me cried 0
Syme with extraordinary emphasis 0
Shall I tell you 0
the secret of the 0
It is that we 0
have only known the 0
back of the world 0
We see everything from 0
behind and it looks 0
That is not a 0
tree but the back 0
That is not a 0
cloud but the back 0
Cannot you see that 0
everything is stooping and 0
If we could only 0
get round in front 0
cried out Bull clamorously 0
the balloon is coming 0
There was no need 0
to cry out to 0
Syme who had never 0
taken his eyes off 0
He saw the great 0
luminous globe suddenly stagger 0
in the sky right 0
itself and then sink 0
slowly behind the trees 0
like a setting sun 0
The man called Gogol 0
who had hardly spoken 0
through all their weary 0
travels suddenly threw up 0
his hands like a 0
And now I know 0
he was my friend 0
my friend in the 0
You will not find 0
If he has been 0
tipped out of the 0
car we shall find 0
him rolling as a 0
colt rolls in a 0
field kicking his legs 0
Clashing his hoofs said 0
The colts do and 0
You seem to think 0
So he is said 0
the Professor in Greek 0
Don t forget said 0
the Secretary looking down 0
that he also means 0
Syme had stood without 0
hearing any of the 0
It fell over there 0
Let us follow it 0
Then he added with 0
Oh if he has 0
cheated us all by 0
It would be like 0
one of his larks 0
He strode off towards 0
the distant trees with 0
a new energy his 0
rags and ribbons fluttering 0
The others followed him 0
in a more footsore 0
And almost at the 0
same moment all six 0
men realised that they 0
were not alone in 0
Across the square of 0
turf a tall man 0
was advancing towards them 0
leaning on a strange 0
long staff like a 0
He was clad in 0
a fine but old 0
fashioned suit with knee 0
its colour was that 0
shade between blue violet 0
and grey which can 0
be seen in certain 0
shadows of the woodland 0
His hair was whitish 0
grey and at the 0
first glance taken along 0
with his knee breeches 0
looked as if it 0
His advance was very 0
but for the silver 0
frost upon his head 0
he might have been 0
one to the shadows 0
Gentlemen he said my 0
master has a carriage 0
waiting for you in 0
the road just by 0
Who is your master 0
asked Syme standing quite 0
I was told you 0
knew his name said 0
There was a silence 0
and then the Secretary 0
Where is this carriage 0
It has been waiting 0
only a few moments 0
My master has only 0
Syme looked left and 0
right upon the patch 0
of green field in 0
which he found himself 0
The hedges were ordinary 0
hedges the trees seemed 0
yet he felt like 0
a man entrapped in 0
He looked the mysterious 0
ambassador up and down 0
but he could discover 0
nothing except that the 0
man s coat was 0
the exact colour of 0
the purple shadows and 0
that the man s 0
face was the exact 0
colour of the red 0
and brown and golden 0
Show us the place 0
Syme said briefly and 0
without a word the 0
man in the violet 0
coat turned his back 0
and walked towards a 0
gap in the hedge 0
which let in suddenly 0
the light of a 0
As the six wanderers 0
broke out upon this 0
thoroughfare they saw the 0
white road blocked by 0
what looked like a 0
long row of carriages 0
such a row of 0
carriages as might close 0
the approach to some 0
house in Park Lane 0
Along the side of 0
these carriages stood a 0
rank of splendid servants 0
all dressed in the 0
grey blue uniform and 0
all having a certain 0
quality of stateliness and 0
freedom which would not 0
commonly belong to the 0
servants of a gentleman 0
but rather to the 0
officials and ambassadors of 0
There were no less 0
than six carriages waiting 0
one for each of 0
the tattered and miserable 0
as if in court 0
wore swords and as 0
each man crawled into 0
his carriage they drew 0
them and saluted with 0
a sudden blaze of 0
What can it all 0
asked Bull of Syme 0
Is this another joke 0
I don t know 0
said Syme as he 0
sank wearily back in 0
the cushions of his 0
but if it is 0
it s one of 0
the jokes you talk 0
It s a good 0
The six adventurers had 0
passed through many adventures 0
but not one had 0
carried them so utterly 0
off their feet as 0
this last adventure of 0
They had all become 0
inured to things going 0
but things suddenly going 0
They could not even 0
feebly imagine what the 0
it was enough for 0
them to know that 0
they were carriages and 0
They could not conceive 0
who the old man 0
was who had led 0
but it was quite 0
enough that he had 0
certainly led them to 0
Syme drove through a 0
drifting darkness of trees 0
It was typical of 0
him that while he 0
had carried his bearded 0
chin forward fiercely so 0
long as anything could 0
be done when the 0
whole business was taken 0
out of his hands 0
he fell back on 0
the cushions in a 0
Very gradually and very 0
vaguely he realised into 0
what rich roads the 0
carriage was carrying him 0
He saw that they 0
passed the stone gates 0
of what might have 0
been a park that 0
they began gradually to 0
climb a hill which 0
while wooded on both 0
sides was somewhat more 0
orderly than a forest 0
Then there began to 0
grow upon him as 0
upon a man slowly 0
waking from a healthy 0
sleep a pleasure in 0
He felt that the 0
hedges were what hedges 0
should be living walls 0
that a hedge is 0
like a human army 0
disciplined but all the 0
He saw high elms 0
behind the hedges and 0
vaguely thought how happy 0
boys would be climbing 0
Then his carriage took 0
a turn of the 0
path and he saw 0
suddenly and quietly like 0
a long low sunset 0
cloud a long low 0
house mellow in the 0
mild light of sunset 0
All the six friends 0
compared notes afterwards and 0
but they all agreed 0
that in some unaccountable 0
way the place reminded 0
them of their boyhood 0
It was either this 0
elm top or that 0
crooked path it was 0
either this scrap of 0
orchard or that shape 0
but each man of 0
them declared that he 0
could remember this place 0
before he could remember 0
When the carriages eventually 0
rolled up to a 0
large low cavernous gateway 0
another man in the 0
same uniform but wearing 0
a silver star on 0
the grey breast of 0
his coat came out 0
This impressive person said 0
to the bewildered Syme 0
Refreshments are provided for 0
you in your room 0
Syme under the influence 0
of the same mesmeric 0
sleep of amazement went 0
up the large oaken 0
stairs after the respectful 0
He entered a splendid 0
suite of apartments that 0
seemed to be designed 0
He walked up to 0
a long mirror with 0
the ordinary instinct of 0
his class to pull 0
his tie straight or 0
to smooth his hair 0
and there he saw 0
the frightful figure that 0
he was blood running 0
down his face from 0
where the bough had 0
struck him his hair 0
standing out like yellow 0
rags of rank grass 0
his clothes torn into 0
At once the whole 0
enigma sprang up simply 0
as the question of 0
how he had got 0
there and how he 0
was to get out 0
Exactly at the same 0
moment a man in 0
blue who had been 0
appointed as his valet 0
I have put out 0
I have no clothes 0
except these and he 0
lifted two long strips 0
of his frock coat 0
in fascinating festoons and 0
made a movement as 0
if to twirl like 0
My master asks me 0
to say said the 0
attendant that there is 0
a fancy dress ball 0
tonight and that he 0
desires you to put 0
on the costume that 0
I have laid out 0
Meanwhile sir there is 0
a bottle of Burgundy 0
and some cold pheasant 0
which he hopes you 0
will not refuse as 0
it is some hours 0
Cold pheasant is a 0
good thing said Syme 0
reflectively and Burgundy is 0
a spanking good thing 0
But really I do 0
not want either of 0
them so much as 0
I want to know 0
what the devil all 0
this means and what 0
sort of costume you 0
have got laid out 0
The servant lifted off 0
a kind of ottoman 0
a long peacock blue 0
drapery rather of the 0
nature of a domino 0
on the front of 0
which was emblazoned a 0
large golden sun and 0
which was splashed here 0
and there with flaming 0
You re to be 0
dressed as Thursday sir 0
said the valet somewhat 0
said Syme in meditation 0
It doesn t sound 0
Oh yes sir said 0
the other eagerly the 0
Thursday costume is quite 0
It fastens up to 0
Well I don t 0
understand anything said Syme 0
I have been used 0
so long to uncomfortable 0
adventures that comfortable adventures 0
Still I may be 0
allowed to ask why 0
I should be particularly 0
like Thursday in a 0
green frock spotted all 0
over with the sun 0
Those orbs I think 0
shine on other days 0
I once saw the 0
moon on Tuesday I 0
Beg pardon sir said 0
the valet Bible also 0
provided for you and 0
with a respectful and 0
rigid finger he pointed 0
out a passage in 0
the first chapter of 0
Syme read it wondering 0
It was that in 0
which the fourth day 0
of the week is 0
associated with the creation 0
of the sun and 0
Here however they reckoned 0
from a Christian Sunday 0
This is getting wilder 0
and wilder said Syme 0
as he sat down 0
Who are these people 0
who provide cold pheasant 0
and Burgundy and green 0
Do they provide everything 0
Yes sir everything said 0
Shall I help you 0
on with your costume 0
Oh hitch the bally 0
But though he affected 0
to despise the mummery 0
he felt a curious 0
freedom and naturalness in 0
his movements as the 0
blue and gold garment 0
and when he found 0
that he had to 0
wear a sword it 0
stirred a boyish dream 0
As he passed out 0
of the room he 0
flung the folds across 0
his shoulder with a 0
gesture his sword stood 0
out at an angle 0
and he had all 0
the swagger of a 0
For these disguises did 0
not disguise but reveal 0
CHAPTER XV THE ACCUSER 0
AS Syme strode along 0
the corridor he saw 0
the Secretary standing at 0
the top of a 0
great flight of stairs 0
The man had never 0
He was draped in 0
a long robe of 0
starless black down the 0
centre of which fell 0
a band or broad 0
stripe of pure white 0
like a single shaft 0
The whole looked like 0
some very severe ecclesiastical 0
There was no need 0
for Syme to search 0
his memory or the 0
Bible in order to 0
remember that the first 0
day of creation marked 0
the mere creation of 0
light out of darkness 0
The vestment itself would 0
alone have suggested the 0
and Syme felt also 0
how perfectly this pattern 0
of pure white and 0
black expressed the soul 0
of the pale and 0
austere Secretary with his 0
inhuman veracity and his 0
cold frenzy which made 0
him so easily make 0
war on the anarchists 0
and yet so easily 0
pass for one of 0
Syme was scarcely surprised 0
to notice that amid 0
all the ease and 0
hospitality of their new 0
surroundings this man s 0
eyes were still stern 0
No smell of ale 0
or orchards could make 0
the Secretary cease to 0
ask a reasonable question 0
If Syme had been 0
able to see himself 0
he would have realised 0
that he too seemed 0
to be for the 0
first time himself and 0
For if the Secretary 0
stood for that philosopher 0
who loves the original 0
and formless light Syme 0
was a type of 0
the poet who seeks 0
always to make the 0
light in special shapes 0
to split it up 0
into sun and star 0
The philosopher may sometimes 0
the poet always loves 0
For him the great 0
moment is not the 0
creation of light but 0
the creation of the 0
As they descended the 0
broad stairs together they 0
overtook Ratcliffe who was 0
clad in spring green 0
like a huntsman and 0
the pattern upon whose 0
garment was a green 0
For he stood for 0
that third day on 0
which the earth and 0
green things were made 0
and his square sensible 0
face with its not 0
unfriendly cynicism seemed appropriate 0
They were led out 0
of another broad and 0
low gateway into a 0
very large old English 0
garden full of torches 0
and bonfires by the 0
broken light of which 0
a vast carnival of 0
people were dancing in 0
Syme seemed to see 0
every shape in Nature 0
imitated in some crazy 0
There was a man 0
dressed as a windmill 0
with enormous sails a 0
man dressed as an 0
elephant a man dressed 0
the two last together 0
seemed to keep the 0
thread of their farcical 0
Syme even saw with 0
a queer thrill one 0
dancer dressed like an 0
enormous hornbill with a 0
beak twice as big 0
as himself the queer 0
bird which had fixed 0
itself on his fancy 0
like a living question 0
while he was rushing 0
down the long road 0
at the Zoological Gardens 0
There were a thousand 0
other such objects however 0
There was a dancing 0
lamp post a dancing 0
apple tree a dancing 0
One would have thought 0
that the untamable tune 0
of some mad musician 0
had set all the 0
common objects of field 0
and street dancing an 0
And long afterwards when 0
Syme was middle aged 0
and at rest he 0
could never see one 0
of those particular objects 0
a lamppost or an 0
apple tree or a 0
windmill without thinking that 0
it was a strayed 0
reveller from that revel 0
On one side of 0
this lawn alive with 0
dancers was a sort 0
of green bank like 0
the terrace in such 0
Along this in a 0
kind of crescent stood 0
seven great chairs the 0
thrones of the seven 0
Bull were already in 0
the Professor was just 0
Gogol or Tuesday had 0
his simplicity well symbolised 0
by a dress designed 0
upon the division of 0
the waters a dress 0
that separated upon his 0
forehead and fell to 0
his feet grey and 0
silver like a sheet 0
The Professor whose day 0
was that on which 0
the birds and fishes 0
the ruder forms of 0
life were created had 0
a dress of dim 0
purple over which sprawled 0
goggle eyed fishes and 0
outrageous tropical birds the 0
union in him of 0
unfathomable fancy and of 0
Bull the last day 0
of Creation wore a 0
coat covered with heraldic 0
animals in red and 0
gold and on his 0
crest a man rampant 0
He lay back in 0
his chair with a 0
broad smile the picture 0
of an optimist in 0
One by one the 0
wanderers ascended the bank 0
and sat in their 0
As each of them 0
sat down a roar 0
of enthusiasm rose from 0
the carnival such as 0
that with which crowds 0
Cups were clashed and 0
torches shaken and feathered 0
hats flung in the 0
The men for whom 0
these thrones were reserved 0
were men crowned with 0
But the central chair 0
Syme was on the 0
left hand of it 0
and the Secretary on 0
The Secretary looked across 0
the empty throne at 0
Syme and said compressing 0
We do not know 0
yet that he is 0
not dead in a 0
Almost as Syme heard 0
the words he saw 0
on the sea of 0
human faces in front 0
of him a frightful 0
and beautiful alteration as 0
if heaven had opened 0
But Sunday had only 0
passed silently along the 0
front like a shadow 0
and had sat in 0
He was draped plainly 0
in a pure and 0
terrible white and his 0
hair was like a 0
silver flame on his 0
For a long time 0
it seemed for hours 0
that huge masquerade of 0
mankind swayed and stamped 0
in front of them 0
to marching and exultant 0
Every couple dancing seemed 0
it might be a 0
fairy dancing with a 0
pillar box or a 0
peasant girl dancing with 0
but in each case 0
it was somehow as 0
absurd as Alice in 0
Wonderland yet as grave 0
and kind as a 0
At last however the 0
thick crowd began to 0
Couples strolled away into 0
the garden walks or 0
began to drift towards 0
that end of the 0
building where stood smoking 0
in huge pots like 0
fish kettles some hot 0
and scented mixtures of 0
old ale or wine 0
Above all these upon 0
a sort of black 0
framework on the roof 0
of the house roared 0
in its iron basket 0
a gigantic bonfire which 0
lit up the land 0
It flung the homely 0
effect of firelight over 0
the face of vast 0
forests of grey or 0
brown and it seemed 0
to fill with warmth 0
even the emptiness of 0
Yet this also after 0
a time was allowed 0
the dim groups gathered 0
more and more round 0
the great cauldrons or 0
passed laughing and clattering 0
into the inner passages 0
of that ancient house 0
Soon there were only 0
some ten loiterers in 0
Finally the last stray 0
merry maker ran into 0
the house whooping to 0
The fire faded and 0
the slow strong stars 0
And the seven strange 0
men were left alone 0
like seven stone statues 0
on their chairs of 0
Not one of them 0
had spoken a word 0
They seemed in no 0
haste to do so 0
but heard in silence 0
the hum of insects 0
and the distant song 0
Then Sunday spoke but 0
so dreamily that he 0
might have been continuing 0
a conversation rather than 0
We will eat and 0
drink later he said 0
Let us remain together 0
a little we who 0
have loved each other 0
so sadly and have 0
I seem to remember 0
only centuries of heroic 0
war in which you 0
were always heroes epic 0
on epic iliad on 0
iliad and you always 0
Whether it was but 0
for time is nothing 0
or at the beginning 0
of the world I 0
sent you out to 0
I sat in the 0
darkness where there is 0
not any created thing 0
and to you I 0
was only a voice 0
commanding valour and an 0
You heard the voice 0
in the dark and 0
you never heard it 0
The sun in heaven 0
denied it the earth 0
and sky denied it 0
all human wisdom denied 0
And when I met 0
you in the daylight 0
I denied it myself 0
Syme stirred sharply in 0
his seat but otherwise 0
there was silence and 0
the incomprehensible went on 0
But you were men 0
You did not forget 0
your secret honour though 0
the whole cosmos turned 0
an engine of torture 0
to tear it out 0
I knew how near 0
you were to hell 0
I know how you 0
Thursday crossed swords with 0
King Satan and how 0
you Wednesday named me 0
in the hour without 0
There was complete silence 0
in the starlit garden 0
and then the black 0
browed Secretary implacable turned 0
in his chair towards 0
Sunday and said in 0
Who and what are 0
I am the Sabbath 0
said the other without 0
I am the peace 0
The Secretary started up 0
and stood crushing his 0
costly robe in his 0
I know what you 0
mean he cried and 0
it is exactly that 0
that I cannot forgive 0
I know you are 0
contentment optimism what do 0
they call the thing 0
Well I am not 0
If you were the 0
man in the dark 0
room why were you 0
also Sunday an offense 0
If you were from 0
the first our father 0
and our friend why 0
were you also our 0
We wept we fled 0
the iron entered into 0
our souls and you 0
are the peace of 0
Oh I can forgive 0
God His anger though 0
but I cannot forgive 0
Sunday answered not a 0
word but very slowly 0
he turned his face 0
of stone upon Syme 0
as if asking a 0
No said Syme I 0
do not feel fierce 0
I am grateful to 0
you not only for 0
wine and hospitality here 0
but for many a 0
fine scamper and free 0
But I should like 0
My soul and heart 0
are as happy and 0
quiet here as this 0
old garden but my 0
reason is still crying 0
I should like to 0
Sunday looked at Ratcliffe 0
whose clear voice said 0
It seems so silly 0
that you should have 0
been on both sides 0
l understand nothing but 0
In fact I am 0
I am not happy 0
said the Professor with 0
his head in his 0
hands because I do 0
You let me stray 0
a little too near 0
And then Gogol said 0
with the absolute simplicity 0
I wish I knew 0
why I was hurt 0
Still Sunday said nothing 0
but only sat with 0
his mighty chin upon 0
his hand and gazed 0
Then at last he 0
I have heard your 0
And here I think 0
comes another to complain 0
and we will hear 0
The falling fire in 0
the great cresset threw 0
a last long gleam 0
like a bar of 0
burning gold across the 0
Against this fiery band 0
was outlined in utter 0
black the advancing legs 0
of a black clad 0
He seemed to have 0
a fine close suit 0
with knee breeches such 0
as that which was 0
worn by the servants 0
of the house only 0
that it was not 0
blue but of this 0
He had like the 0
servants a kind of 0
word by his side 0
It was only when 0
he had come quite 0
close to the crescent 0
of the seven and 0
flung up his face 0
to look at them 0
that Syme saw with 0
thunder struck clearness that 0
the face was the 0
broad almost ape like 0
face of his old 0
friend Gregory with its 0
rank red hair and 0
gasped Syme half rising 0
Why this is the 0
Yes said Gregory with 0
a great and dangerous 0
restraint I am the 0
Now there was a 0
day murmured Bull who 0
seemed really to have 0
fallen asleep when the 0
sons of God came 0
to present themselves before 0
the Lord and Satan 0
came also among them 0
You are right said 0
Gregory and gazed all 0
I am a destroyer 0
I would destroy the 0
world if I could 0
A sense of a 0
pathos far under the 0
earth stirred up in 0
Syme and he spoke 0
brokenly and without sequence 0
Oh most unhappy man 0
he cried try to 0
You have red hair 0
My red hair like 0
red flames shall burn 0
up the world said 0
I thought I hated 0
everything more than common 0
men can hate anything 0
but I find that 0
I do not hate 0
everything so much as 0
I never hated you 0
said Syme very sadly 0
Then out of this 0
unintelligible creature the last 0
You never hated because 0
I know what you 0
are all of you 0
from first to last 0
you are the people 0
You are the police 0
the great fat smiling 0
men in blue and 0
You are the Law 0
and you have never 0
But is there a 0
free soul alive that 0
does not long to 0
break you only because 0
you have never been 0
We in revolt talk 0
all kind of nonsense 0
doubtless about this crime 0
or that crime of 0
It is all folly 0
The only crime of 0
the Government is that 0
The unpardonable sin of 0
the supreme power is 0
that it is supreme 0
I do not curse 0
you for being cruel 0
I do not curse 0
I curse you for 0
You sit in your 0
chairs of stone and 0
have never come down 0
You are the seven 0
angels of heaven and 0
you have had no 0
Oh I could forgive 0
you everything you that 0
rule all mankind if 0
I could feel for 0
once that you had 0
suffered for one hour 0
a real agony such 0
Syme sprang to his 0
feet shaking from head 0
I see everything he 0
cried everything that there 0
Why does each thing 0
on the earth war 0
against each other thing 0
Why does each small 0
thing in the world 0
have to fight against 0
Why does a fly 0
have to fight the 0
Why does a dandelion 0
have to fight the 0
For the same reason 0
that I had to 0
be alone in the 0
dreadful Council of the 0
So that each thing 0
that obeys law may 0
have the glory and 0
isolation of the anarchist 0
So that each man 0
fighting for order may 0
be as brave and 0
good a man as 0
So that the real 0
lie of Satan may 0
be flung back in 0
the face of this 0
blasphemer so that by 0
tears and torture we 0
may earn the right 0
to say to this 0
No agonies can be 0
too great to buy 0
the right to say 0
to this accuser We 0
It is not true 0
that we have never 0
We have been broken 0
It is not true 0
that we have never 0
descended from these thrones 0
We have descended into 0
We were complaining of 0
unforgettable miseries even at 0
the very moment when 0
this man entered insolently 0
to accuse us of 0
I repel the slander 0
we have not been 0
I can answer for 0
every one of the 0
great guards of Law 0
whom he has accused 0
He had turned his 0
eyes so as to 0
see suddenly the great 0
face of Sunday which 0
wore a strange smile 0
Have you he cried 0
in a dreadful voice 0
have you ever suffered 0
As he gazed the 0
great face grew to 0
an awful size grew 0
larger than the colossal 0
mask of Memnon which 0
had made him scream 0
It grew larger and 0
larger filling the whole 0
then everything went black 0
Only in the blackness 0
before it entirely destroyed 0
his brain he seemed 0
to hear a distant 0
voice saying a commonplace 0
text that he had 0
heard somewhere Can ye 0
drink of the cup 0
that I drink of 0
When men in books 0
awake from a vision 0
they commonly find themselves 0
in some place in 0
which they might have 0
they yawn in a 0
chair or lift themselves 0
with bruised limbs from 0
Syme s experience was 0
something much more psychologically 0
strange if there was 0
indeed anything unreal in 0
the earthly sense about 0
the things he had 0
For while he could 0
always remember afterwards that 0
he had swooned before 0
the face of Sunday 0
he could not remember 0
having ever come to 0
He could only remember 0
that gradually and naturally 0
he knew that he 0
was and had been 0
walking along a country 0
lane with an easy 0
That companion had been 0
a part of his 0
it was the red 0
They were walking like 0
old friends and were 0
in the middle of 0
a conversation about some 0
But Syme could only 0
feel an unnatural buoyancy 0
in his body and 0
a crystal simplicity in 0
his mind that seemed 0
to be superior to 0
everything that he said 0
He felt he was 0
in possession of some 0
impossible good news which 0
made every other thing 0
a triviality but an 0
Dawn was breaking over 0
everything in colours at 0
once clear and timid 0
as if Nature made 0
a first attempt at 0
yellow and a first 0
A breeze blew so 0
clean and sweet that 0
one could not think 0
that it blew from 0
it blew rather through 0
some hole in the 0
Syme felt a simple 0
surprise when he saw 0
rising all round him 0
on both sides of 0
the road the red 0
irregular buildings of Saffron 0
He had no idea 0
that he had walked 0
He walked by instinct 0
along one white road 0
on which early birds 0
hopped and sang and 0
found himself outside a 0
There he saw the 0
sister of Gregory the 0
girl with the gold 0
red hair cutting lilac 0
before breakfast with the 0
great unconscious gravity of 0
