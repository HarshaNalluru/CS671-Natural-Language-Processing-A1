The Man Who Was Thursday by G K Chesterton 1908To Edmund Clerihew Bentley
<s>A cloud was on the mind of men and wailing went the weatherYea a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boys together</s>
<s>Science announced nonentity and art admired decayThe world was old and ended but you and I were gayRound us in antic order their crippled vices cameLust that had lost its laughter fear that had lost its shame</s>
<s>Like the white lock of Whistler that lit our aimless gloomMen showed their own white feather as proudly as a plume</s>
<s>Life was a fly that faded and death a drone that stungThe world was very old indeed when you and I were young</s>
<s>They twisted even decent sin to shapes not to be namedMen were ashamed of honour but we were not ashamed</s>
<s>Weak if we were and foolish not thus we failed not thusWhen that black Baal blocked the heavens he had no hymns from usChildren we wereour forts of sand were even as weak as eveHigh as they went we piled them up to break that bitter sea</s>
<s>Fools as we were in motley all jangling and absurdWhen all church bells were silent our cap and beds were heard</s>
<s>Not all unhelped we held the fort our tiny flags unfurledSome giants laboured in that cloud to lift it from the world</s>
<s>I find again the book we found I feel the hour that flingsFar out of fishshaped Paumanok some cry of cleaner thingsAnd the Green Carnation withered as in forest fires that passRoared in the wind of all the world ten million leaves of grassOr sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sings in the rainTruth out of Tusitala spoke and pleasure out of pain</s>
<s>Yea cool and clear and sudden as a bird sings in the greyDunedin to Samoa spoke and darkness unto day</s>
<s>But we were young we lived to see God break their bitter charms</s>
<s>God and the good Republic come riding back in armsWe have seen the City of Mansoul even as it rocked relievedBlessed are they who did not see but being blind believed</s>
<s>This is a tale of those old fears even of those emptied hellsAnd none but you shall understand the true thing that it tellsOf what colossal gods of shame could cow men and yet crashOf what huge devils hid the stars yet fell at a pistol flash</s>
<s>The doubts that were so plain to chase so dreadful to withstandOh who shall understand but you yea who shall understand</s>
<s>The doubts that drove us through the night as we two talked amainAnd day had broken on the streets eer it broke upon the brain</s>
<s>Between us by the peace of God such truth can now be toldYea there is strength in striking root and good in growing old</s>
<s>We have found common things at last and marriage and a creedAnd I may safely write it now and you may safely read</s>G K CCHAPTER ITHE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK
<s>THE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London asred and ragged as a cloud of sunset</s> 
<s>It was built of a brightbrick throughout its skyline was fantastic and even its groundplan was wild</s> 
<s>It had been the outburst of a speculative builderfaintly tinged with art who called its architecture sometimesElizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne apparently under theimpression that the two sovereigns were identical</s> 
<s>It was describedwith some justice as an artistic colony though it never in anydefinable way produced any art</s> 
<s>But although its pretensions to bean intellectual centre were a little vague its pretensions to be apleasant place were quite indisputable</s> 
<s>The stranger who looked forthe first time at the quaint red houses could only think how veryoddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them</s> 
<s>Nor whenhe met the people was he disappointed in this respect</s> 
<s>The placewas not only pleasant but perfect if once he could regard it notas a deception but rather as a dream</s> 
<s>Even if the people were notartists the whole was nevertheless artistic</s> 
<s>That young man withthe long auburn hair and the impudent facethat young man was notreally a poet but surely he was a poem</s> 
<s>That old gentleman withthe wild white beard and the wild white hatthat venerablehumbug was not really a philosopher but at least he was the causeof philosophy in others</s> 
<s>That scientific gentleman with the baldegglike head and the bare birdlike neck had no real right to theairs of science that he assumed</s> 
<s>He had not discovered anything newin biology but what biological creature could he have discoveredmore singular than himself</s> 
<s>Thus and thus only the whole placehad properly to be regarded it had to be considered not so muchas a workshop for artists but as a frail but finished work of art</s>
<s>A man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he hadstepped into a written comedy</s>
<s>More especially this attractive unreality fell upon it aboutnightfall when the extravagant roofs were dark against theafterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as adrifting cloud</s> 
<s>This again was more strongly true of the manynights of local festivity when the little gardens were oftenilluminated and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfishtrees like some fierce and monstrous fruit</s> 
<s>And this was strongestof all on one particular evening still vaguely remembered in thelocality of which the auburnhaired poet was the hero</s> 
<s>It was notby any means the only evening of which he was the hero</s> 
<s>On manynights those passing by his little back garden might hear his highdidactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly towomen</s> 
<s>The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of theparadoxes of the place</s> 
<s>Most of the women were of the kind vaguelycalled emancipated and professed some protest against malesupremacy</s> 
<s>Yet these new women would always pay to a man theextravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to himthat of listening while he is talking</s> 
<s>And Mr Lucian Gregory theredhaired poet was really (in some sense) a man worth listeningto even if one only laughed at the end of it</s> 
<s>He put the old cantof the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certainimpudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure</s> 
<s>He washelped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearancewhich he worked as the phrase goes for all it was worth</s> 
<s>His darkred hair parted in the middle was literally like a womans andcurved into the slow curls of a virgin in a preRaphaelite picture</s>
<s>From within this almost saintly oval however his face projectedsuddenly broad and brutal the chin carried forward with a look ofcockney contempt</s> 
<s>This combination at once tickled and terrifiedthe nerves of a neurotic population</s> 
<s>He seemed like a walkingblasphemy a blend of the angel and the ape</s>
<s>This particular evening if it is remembered for nothing elsewill be remembered in that place for its strange sunset</s> 
<s>It lookedlike the end of the world</s> 
<s>All the heaven seemed covered with aquite vivid and palpable plumage you could only say that the skywas full of feathers and of feathers that almost brushed theface</s> 
<s>Across the great part of the dome they were grey with thestrangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or palegreen but towards the west the whole grew past descriptiontransparent and passionate and the last redhot plumes of itcovered up the sun like something too good to be seen</s> 
<s>The wholewas so close about the earth as to express nothing but a violentsecrecy</s> 
<s>The very empyrean seemed to be a secret</s> 
<s>It expressedthat splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism</s> 
<s>Thevery sky seemed small</s>
<s>I say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the eveningif only by that oppressive sky</s> 
<s>There are others who may rememberit because it marked the first appearance in the place of thesecond poet of Saffron Park</s> 
<s>For a long time the redhairedrevolutionary had reigned without a rival it was upon the nightof the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended</s> 
<s>The new poet whointroduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a verymildlooking mortal with a fair pointed beard and faint yellowhair</s> 
<s>But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked</s>
<s>He signalised his entrance by differing with the established poetGregory upon the whole nature of poetry</s> 
<s>He said that he (Syme)was poet of law a poet of order nay he said he was a poet ofrespectability</s> 
<s>So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if hehad that moment fallen out of that impossible sky</s>
<s>In fact Mr Lucian Gregory the anarchic poet connected the twoevents</s>
<s>It may well be he said in his sudden lyrical manner it maywell be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there isbrought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet</s>
<s>You say you are a poet of law I say you are a contradiction interms</s> 
<s>I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on thenight you appeared in this garden</s>
<s>The man with the meek blue eyes and the pale pointed beard enduredthese thunders with a certain submissive solemnity</s> 
<s>The third partyof the group Gregorys sister Rosamond who had her brothersbraids of red hair but a kindlier face underneath them laughedwith such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gavecommonly to the family oracle</s>
<s>Gregory resumed in high oratorical good humour</s>
<s>An artist is identical with an anarchist he cried</s> 
<s>You mighttranspose the words anywhere</s> 
<s>An anarchist is an artist</s> 
<s>The manwho throws a bomb is an artist because he prefers a great momentto everything</s> 
<s>He sees how much more valuable is one burst ofblazing light one peal of perfect thunder than the mere commonbodies of a few shapeless policemen</s> 
<s>An artist disregards allgovernments abolishes all conventions</s> 
<s>The poet delights indisorder only</s> 
<s>If it were not so the most poetical thing in theworld would be the Underground Railway</s>
<s>So it is said Mr Syme</s>
<s>Nonsense</s> 
<s>said Gregory who was very rational when anyone elseattempted paradox</s> 
<s>Why do all the clerks and navvies in therailway trains look so sad and tired so very sad and tired</s> 
<s>I willtell you</s> 
<s>It is because they know that the train is going right</s> 
<s>Itis because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticketfor that place they will reach</s> 
<s>It is because after they havepassed Sloane Square they know that the next station must beVictoria and nothing but Victoria</s> 
<s>Oh their wild rapture</s> 
<s>ohtheir eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden if the nextstation were unaccountably Baker Street</s>
<s>It is you who are unpoetical replied the poet Syme</s> 
<s>If what yousay of clerks is true they can only be as prosaic as your poetry</s>
<s>The rare strange thing is to hit the mark the gross obviousthing is to miss it</s> 
<s>We feel it is epical when man with one wildarrow strikes a distant bird</s> 
<s>Is it not also epical when man withone wild engine strikes a distant station</s> 
<s>Chaos is dull becausein chaos the train might indeed go anywhere to Baker Street or toBagdad</s> 
<s>But man is a magician and his whole magic is in this thathe does say Victoria and lo</s> 
<s>it is Victoria</s> 
<s>No take your booksof mere poetry and prose let me read a time table with tears ofpride</s> 
<s>Take your Byron who commemorates the defeats of man giveme Bradshaw who commemorates his victories</s> 
<s>Give me Bradshaw Isay</s>
<s>Must you go</s> 
<s>inquired Gregory sarcastically</s>
<s>I tell you went on Syme with passion that every time a traincomes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers andthat man has won a battle against chaos</s> 
<s>You say contemptuouslythat when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria</s> 
<s>Isay that one might do a thousand things instead and that wheneverI really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape</s> 
<s>Andwhen I hear the guard shout out the word Victoria it is not anunmeaning word</s> 
<s>It is to me the cry of a herald announcingconquest</s> 
<s>It is to me indeed Victoria it is the victory ofAdam</s>
<s>Gregory wagged his heavy red head with a slow and sad smile</s>
<s>And even then he said we poets always ask the question Andwhat is Victoria now that you have got there </s> 
<s>You think Victoriais like the New Jerusalem</s> 
<s>We know that the New Jerusalem will onlybe like Victoria</s> 
<s>Yes the poet will be discontented even in thestreets of heaven</s> 
<s>The poet is always in revolt</s>
<s>There again said Syme irritably what is there poetical aboutbeing in revolt </s> 
<s>You might as well say that it is poetical to beseasick</s> 
<s>Being sick is a revolt</s> 
<s>Both being sick and beingrebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperateoccasions but Im hanged if I can see why they are poetical</s>
<s>Revolt in the abstract isrevolting</s> 
<s>Its mere vomiting</s>
<s>The girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word but Syme wastoo hot to heed her</s>
<s>It is things going right he cried that is poetical I Ourdigestions for instance going sacredly and silently right thatis the foundation of all poetry</s> 
<s>Yes the most poetical thing morepoetical than the flowers more poetical than the starsthe mostpoetical thing in the world is not being sick</s>
<s>Really said Gregory superciliously the examples you choose</s>
<s>I beg your pardon said Syme grimly I forgot we had abolishedall conventions</s>
<s>For the first time a red patch appeared on Gregorys forehead</s>
<s>You dont expect me he said to revolutionise society on thislawn </s>
<s>Syme looked straight into his eyes and smiled sweetly</s>
<s>No I dont he said but I suppose that if you were seriousabout your anarchism that is exactly what you would do</s>
<s>Gregorys big bulls eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angrylion and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose</s>
<s>Dont you think then he said in a dangerous voice that I amserious about my anarchism</s>
<s>I beg your pardon </s> 
<s>said Syme</s>
<s>Am I not serious about my anarchism </s> 
<s>cried Gregory with knottedfists</s>
<s>My dear fellow</s> 
<s>said Syme and strolled away</s>
<s>With surprise but with a curious pleasure he found RosamondGregory still in his company</s>
<s>Mr Syme she said do the people who talk like you and mybrother often mean what they say </s> 
<s>Do you mean what you say now </s>
<s>Syme smiled</s>
<s>Do you </s> 
<s>he asked</s>
<s>What do you mean </s> 
<s>asked the girl with grave eyes</s>
<s>My dear Miss Gregory said Syme gently there are many kinds ofsincerity and insincerity</s> 
<s>When you say thank you for the saltdo you mean what you say </s> 
<s>No</s> 
<s>When you say the world is rounddo you mean what you say </s> 
<s>No</s> 
<s>It is true but you dont mean it</s>
<s>Now sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he doesmean</s> 
<s>It may be only a halftruth quartertruth tenthtruth butthen he says more than he meansfrom sheer force of meaning it</s>
<s>She was looking at him from under level brows her face was graveand open and there had fallen upon it the shadow of thatunreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the mostfrivolous woman the maternal watch which is as old as the world</s>
<s>Is he really an anarchist then</s> 
<s>she asked</s>
<s>Only in that sense I speak of replied Syme or if you preferit in that nonsense</s>
<s>She drew her broad brows together and said abruptly</s>
<s>He wouldnt really usebombs or that sort of thing</s>
<s>Syme broke into a great laugh that seemed too large for his slightand somewhat dandified figure</s>
<s>Good Lord no</s> 
<s>he said that has to be done anonymously</s>
<s>And at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile andshe thought with a simultaneous pleasure of Gregorys absurdityand of his safety</s>
<s>Syme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden andcontinued to pour out his opinions</s> 
<s>For he was a sincere man andin spite of his superficial airs and graces at root a humble one</s>
<s>And it is always the humble man who talks too much the proud manwatches himself too closely</s> 
<s>He defended respectability withviolence and exaggeration</s> 
<s>He grew passionate in his praise oftidiness and propriety</s> 
<s>All the time there was a smell of lilacall round him</s> 
<s>Once he heard very faintly in some distant street abarrelorgan begin to play and it seemed to him that his heroicwords were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world</s>
<s>He stared and talked at the girls red hair and amused face forwhat seemed to be a few minutes and then feeling that the groupsin such a place should mix rose to his feet</s> 
<s>To his astonishmenthe discovered the whole garden empty</s> 
<s>Everyone had gone long agoand he went himself with a rather hurried apology</s> 
<s>He left with asense of champagne in his head which he could not afterwardsexplain</s> 
<s>In the wild events which were to follow this girl had nopart at all he never saw her again until all his tale was over</s>
<s>And yet in some indescribable way she kept recurring like amotive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards and theglory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those darkand illdrawn tapestries of the night</s> 
<s>For what followed was soimprobable that it might well have been a dream</s>
<s>When Syme went out into the starlit street he found it for themoment empty</s> 
<s>Then he realised (in some odd way) that the silencewas rather a living silence than a dead one</s> 
<s>Directly outside thedoor stood a street lamp whose gleam gilded the leaves of the treethat bent out over the fence behind him</s> 
<s>About a foot from thelamppost stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as thelamppost itself</s> 
<s>The tall hat and long frock coat were black theface in an abrupt shadow was almost as dark</s> 
<s>Only a fringe offiery hair against the light and also something aggressive in theattitude proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory</s> 
<s>He had somethingof the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe</s>
<s>He made a sort of doubtful salute which Syme somewhat moreformally returned</s>
<s>I was waiting for you said Gregory</s> 
<s>Might I have a momentsconversation</s>
<s>Certainly</s> 
<s>About what</s> 
<s>asked Syme in a sort of weak wonder</s>
<s>Gregory struck out with his stick at the lamppost and then at thetree</s> 
<s>About this and this he cried about order and anarchy</s>
<s>There is your precious order that lean iron lamp ugly andbarren and there is anarchy rich living reproducingitselfthere is anarchy splendid in green and gold</s>
<s>All the same replied Syme patiently just at present you onlysee the tree by the light of the lamp</s> 
<s>I wonder when you would eversee the lamp by the light of the tree</s> 
<s>Then after a pause he saidBut may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark onlyto resume our little argument</s>
<s>No cried out Gregory in a voice that rang down the street Idid not stand here to resume our argument but to end it for ever</s>
<s>The silence fell again and Syme though he understood nothinglistened instinctively for something serious</s> 
<s>Gregory began in asmooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile</s>
<s>Mr Syme he said this evening you succeeded in doing somethingrather remarkable</s> 
<s>You did something to me that no man born ofwoman has ever succeeded in doing before</s>
<s>Indeed</s>
<s>Now I remember resumed Gregory reflectively one other personsucceeded in doing it</s> 
<s>The captain of a penny steamer (if Iremember correctly) at Southend</s> 
<s>You have irritated me</s>
<s>I am very sorry replied Syme with gravity</s>
<s>I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wipedout even with an apology said Gregory very calmly</s> 
<s>No duelcould wipe it out</s> 
<s>If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out</s>
<s>There is only one way by which that insult can be erased and thatway I choose</s> 
<s>I am going at the possible sacrifice of my life andhonour to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said</s>
<s>In what I said</s>
<s>You said I was not serious about being an anarchist</s>
<s>There are degrees of seriousness replied Syme</s> 
<s>I have neverdoubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense that youthought what you said well worth saying that you thought aparadox might wake men up to a neglected truth</s>
<s>Gregory stared at him steadily and painfully</s>
<s>And in no other sense he asked you think me serious</s> 
<s>You thinkme a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths</s> 
<s>You do not think thatin a deeper a more deadly sense I am serious</s>
<s>Syme struck his stick violently on the stones of the road</s>
<s>Serious</s> 
<s>he cried</s> 
<s>Good Lord</s> 
<s>is this street serious</s> 
<s>Are thesedamned Chinese lanterns serious</s> 
<s>Is the whole caboodle serious</s>
<s>One comes here and talks a pack of bosh and perhaps some sense aswell but I should think very little of a man who didnt keepsomething in the background of his life that was more serious thanall this talkingsomething more serious whether it was religionor only drink</s>
<s>Very well said Gregory his face darkening you shall seesomething more serious than either drink or religion</s>
<s>Syme stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until Gregoryagain opened his lips</s>
<s>You spoke just now of having a religion</s> 
<s>Is it really true thatyou have one</s>
<s>Oh said Syme with a beaming smile we are all Catholics now</s>
<s>Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints yourreligion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going totell you to any son of Adam and especially not to the police</s>
<s>Will you swear that</s> 
<s>If you will take upon yourself this awfulabnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vowthat you should never make and a knowledge you should never dreamabout I will promise you in return</s>
<s>You will promise me in return</s> 
<s>inquired Syme as the otherpaused</s>
<s>I will promise you a very entertaining evening</s> 
<s>Syme suddenlytook off his hat</s>
<s>Your offer he said is far too idiotic to be declined</s> 
<s>You saythat a poet is always an anarchist</s> 
<s>I disagree but I hope at leastthat he is always a sportsman</s> 
<s>Permit me here and now to swear asa Christian and promise as a good comrade and a fellowartistthat I will not report anything of this whatever it is to thepolice</s> 
<s>And now in the name of Colney Hatch what is it</s>
<s>I think said Gregory with placid irrelevancy that we willcall a cab</s>
<s>He gave two long whistles and a hansom came rattling down theroad</s> 
<s>The two got into it in silence</s> 
<s>Gregory gave through thetrap the address of an obscure publichouse on the Chiswick bankof the river</s> 
<s>The cab whisked itself away again and in it thesetwo fantastics quitted their fantastic town</s>CHAPTER IITHE SECRET OF GABRIEL SYME
<s>THE cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershopinto which Gregory rapidly conducted his companion</s> 
<s>They seatedthemselves in a close and dim sort of barparlour at a stainedwooden table with one wooden leg</s> 
<s>The room was so small and darkthat very little could be seen of the attendant who was summonedbeyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded</s>
<s>Will you take a little supper</s> 
<s>asked Gregory politely</s> 
<s>The patede foie gras is not good here but I can recommend the game</s>
<s>Syme received the remark with stolidity imagining it to be a joke</s>
<s>Accepting the vein of humour he said with a wellbredindifference</s>
<s>Oh bring me some lobster mayonnaise</s>
<s>To his indescribable astonishment the man only said Certainlysir</s> 
<s>and went away apparently to get it</s>
<s>What will you drink</s> 
<s>resumed Gregory with the same careless yetapologetic air</s> 
<s>I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself I havedined</s> 
<s>But the champagne can really be trusted</s> 
<s>Do let me start youwith a halfbottle of Pommery at least</s>
<s>Thank you</s> 
<s>said the motionless Syme</s> 
<s>You are very good</s>
<s>His further attempts at conversation somewhat disorganised inthemselves were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by theactual appearance of the lobster</s> 
<s>Syme tasted it and found itparticularly good</s> 
<s>Then he suddenly began to eat with greatrapidity and appetite</s>
<s>Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously</s> 
<s>he said to Gregorysmiling</s> 
<s>I dont often have the luck to have a dream like this</s> 
<s>Itis new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster</s> 
<s>It is commonlythe other way</s>
<s>You are not asleep I assure you said Gregory</s> 
<s>You are on thecontrary close to the most actual and rousing moment of yourexistence</s> 
<s>Ah here comes your champagne</s> 
<s>I admit that there may bea slight disproportion let us say between the inner arrangementsof this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior</s>
<s>But that is all our modesty</s> 
<s>We are the most modest men that everlived on earth</s>
<s>And who are we</s> 
<s>asked Syme emptying his champagne glass</s>
<s>It is quite simple replied Gregory</s> 
<s>We are the seriousanarchists in whom you do not believe</s>
<s>Oh</s> 
<s>said Syme shortly</s> 
<s>You do yourselves well in drinks</s>
<s>Yes we are serious about everything answered Gregory</s>
<s>Then after a pause he added</s>
<s>If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a littledont put it down to your inroads into the champagne</s> 
<s>I dont wishyou to do yourself an injustice</s>
<s>Well if I am not drunk I am mad replied Syme with perfectcalm but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in eithercondition</s> 
<s>May I smoke</s>
<s>Certainly</s> 
<s>said Gregory producing a cigarcase</s> 
<s>Try one ofmine</s>
<s>Syme took the cigar clipped the end off with a cigarcutter outof his waistcoat pocket put it in his mouth lit it slowly andlet out a long cloud of smoke</s> 
<s>It is not a little to his creditthat he performed these rites with so much composure for almostbefore he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun torevolve first slowly and then rapidly as if at an insaneseance</s>
<s>You must not mind it said Gregory its a kind of screw</s>
<s>Quite so said Syme placidly a kind of screw</s> 
<s>How simple thatis</s>
<s>The next moment the smoke of his cigar which had been waveringacross the room in snaky twists went straight up as if from afactory chimney and the two with their chairs and table shotdown through the floor as if the earth had swallowed them</s> 
<s>Theywent rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as rapidly as a liftcut loose and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom</s> 
<s>Butwhen Gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a redsubterranean light Syme was still smoking with one leg thrownover the other and had not turned a yellow hair</s>
<s>Gregory led him down a low vaulted passage at the end of whichwas the red light</s> 
<s>It was an enormous crimson lantern nearly asbig as a fireplace fixed over a small but heavy iron door</s> 
<s>In thedoor there was a sort of hatchway or grating and on this Gregorystruck five times</s> 
<s>A heavy voice with a foreign accent asked himwho he was</s> 
<s>To this he gave the more or less unexpected replyMr Joseph Chamberlain</s> 
<s>The heavy hinges began to move it wasobviously some kind of password</s>
<s>Inside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with anetwork of steel</s> 
<s>On a second glance Syme saw that the glitteringpattern was really made up of ranks and ranks of rifles andrevolvers closely packed or interlocked</s>
<s>I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities said Gregorywe have to be very strict here</s>
<s>Oh dont apologise said Syme</s> 
<s>I know your passion for law andorder and he stepped into the passage lined with the steelweapons</s> 
<s>With his long fair hair and rather foppish frockcoat helooked a singularly frail and fanciful figure as he walked downthat shining avenue of death</s>
<s>They passed through several such passages and came out at lastinto a queer steel chamber with curved walls almost spherical inshape but presenting with its tiers of benches something of theappearance of a scientific lecturetheatre</s> 
<s>There were no rifles orpistols in this apartment but round the walls of it were hung moredubious and dreadful shapes things that looked like the bulbs ofiron plants or the eggs of iron birds</s> 
<s>They were bombs and thevery room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb</s> 
<s>Syme knocked hiscigar ash off against the wall and went in</s>
<s>And now my dear Mr Syme said Gregory throwing himself in anexpansive manner on the bench under the largest bomb now we arequite cosy so let us talk properly</s> 
<s>Now no human words can giveyou any notion of why I brought you here</s> 
<s>It was one of those quitearbitrary emotions like jumping off a cliff or falling in love</s>
<s>Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellowand to do you justice you are still</s> 
<s>I would break twenty oathsof secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg</s> 
<s>That way youhave of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal ofconfession</s> 
<s>Well you said that you were quite certain I was not aserious anarchist</s> 
<s>Does this place strike you as being serious</s>
<s>It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety assentedSyme but may I ask you two questions</s> 
<s>You need not fear to giveme information because as you remember you very wisely extortedfrom me a promise not to tell the police a promise I shallcertainly keep</s> 
<s>So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries</s>
<s>First of all what is it really all about</s> 
<s>What is it you objectto</s> 
<s>You want to abolish Government</s>
<s>To abolish God</s> 
<s>said Gregory opening the eyes of a fanatic</s> 
<s>Wedo not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulationsthat sort of anarchism does exist but it is a mere branch of theNonconformists</s> 
<s>We dig deeper and we blow you higher</s> 
<s>We wish todeny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue honourand treachery upon which mere rebels base themselves</s> 
<s>The sillysentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights ofMan</s> 
<s>We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs</s> 
<s>We have abolished Right andWrong</s>
<s>And Right and Left said Syme with a simple eagerness I hopeyou will abolish them too</s> 
<s>They are much more troublesome to me</s>
<s>You spoke of a second question snapped Gregory</s>
<s>With pleasure resumed Syme</s> 
<s>In all your present acts andsurroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy</s> 
<s>I have anaunt who lived over a shop but this is the first time I havefound people living from preference under a publichouse</s> 
<s>You havea heavy iron door</s> 
<s>You cannot pass it without submitting to thehumiliation of calling yourself Mr Chamberlain</s> 
<s>You surroundyourself with steel instruments which make the place if I may sayso more impressive than homelike</s> 
<s>May I ask why after taking allthis trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earthyou then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism toevery silly woman in Saffron Park</s>
<s>Gregory smiled</s>
<s>The answer is simple he said</s> 
<s>I told you I was a seriousanarchist and you did not believe me</s> 
<s>Nor do they believe me</s>
<s>Unless I took them into this infernal room they would not believeme</s>
<s>Syme smoked thoughtfully and looked at him with interest</s> 
<s>Gregorywent on</s>
<s>The history of the thing might amuse you he said</s> 
<s>When first Ibecame one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectabledisguises</s> 
<s>I dressed up as a bishop</s> 
<s>I read up all about bishopsin our anarchist pamphlets in Superstition the Vampire andPriests of Prey</s> 
<s>I certainly understood from them that bishops arestrange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind</s>
<s>I was misinformed</s> 
<s>When on my first appearing in episcopal gaitersin a drawingroom I cried out in a voice of thunder Down</s> 
<s>down</s>
<s>presumptuous human reason</s> 
<s>they found out in some way that I wasnot a bishop at all</s> 
<s>I was nabbed at once</s> 
<s>Then I made up as amillionaire but I defended Capital with so much intelligence thata fool could see that I was quite poor</s> 
<s>Then I tried being amajor</s> 
<s>Now I am a humanitarian myself but I have I hope enoughintellectual breadth to understand the position of those who likeNietzsche admire violencethe proud mad war of Nature and allthat you know</s> 
<s>I threw myself into the major</s> 
<s>I drew my sword andwaved it constantly</s> 
<s>I called out Blood</s> 
<s>abstractedly like aman calling for wine</s> 
<s>I often said Let the weak perish it isthe Law</s> 
<s>Well well it seems majors dont do this</s> 
<s>I was nabbedagain</s> 
<s>At last I went in despair to the President of the CentralAnarchist Council who is the greatest man in Europe</s>
<s>What is his name</s> 
<s>asked Syme</s>
<s>You would not know it answered Gregory</s> 
<s>That is his greatness</s>
<s>Caesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of andthey were heard of</s> 
<s>He puts all his genius into not being heard ofand he is not heard of</s> 
<s>But you cannot be for five minutes in theroom with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would havebeen children in his hands</s>
<s>He was silent and even pale for a moment and then resumed</s>
<s>But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startlingas an epigram and yet as practical as the Bank of England</s> 
<s>I saidto him What disguise will hide me from the world</s> 
<s>What can I findmore respectable than bishops and majors</s> 
<s>He looked at me with hislarge but indecipherable face</s> 
<s>You want a safe disguise do you</s>
<s>You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless a dress inwhich no one would ever look for a bomb</s> 
<s>I nodded</s> 
<s>He suddenlylifted his lions voice</s> 
<s>Why then dress up as an anarchist youfool</s> 
<s>he roared so that the room shook</s> 
<s>Nobody will ever expectyou to do anything dangerous then</s> 
<s>And he turned his broad backon me without another word</s> 
<s>I took his advice and have neverregretted it</s> 
<s>I preached blood and murder to those women day andnight andby God</s>they 
<s>would let me wheel their perambulators</s>
<s>Syme sat watching him with some respect in his large blue eyes</s>
<s>You took me in he said</s> 
<s>It is really a smart dodge</s>
<s>Then after a pause he added</s>
<s>What do you call this tremendous President of yours</s>
<s>We generally call him Sunday replied Gregory with simplicity</s>
<s>You see there are seven members of the Central AnarchistCouncil and they are named after days of the week</s> 
<s>He is calledSunday by some of his admirers Bloody Sunday</s> 
<s>It is curious youshould mention the matter because the very night you have droppedin (if I may so express it) is the night on which our Londonbranch which assembles in this room has to elect its own deputyto fill a vacancy in the Council</s> 
<s>The gentleman who has for sometime past played with propriety and general applause thedifficult part of Thursday has died quite suddenly</s> 
<s>Consequentlywe have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor</s>
<s>He got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort ofsmiling embarrassment</s>
<s>I feel somehow as if you were my mother Syme he continuedcasually</s> 
<s>I feel that I can confide anything to you as you havepromised to tell nobody</s> 
<s>In fact I will confide to you somethingthat I would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will becoming to the room in about ten minutes</s> 
<s>We shall of course gothrough a form of election but I dont mind telling you that it ispractically certain what the result will be</s> 
<s>He looked down for amoment modestly</s> 
<s>It is almost a settled thing that I am to beThursday</s>
<s>My dear fellow</s> 
<s>said Syme heartily I congratulate you</s> 
<s>A greatcareer</s>
<s>Gregory smiled in deprecation and walked across the room talkingrapidly</s>
<s>As a matter of fact everything is ready for me on this table hesaid and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible</s>
<s>Syme also strolled across to the table and found lying across it awalkingstick which turned out on examination to be a swordsticka large Colts revolver a sandwich case and a formidable flask ofbrandy</s> 
<s>Over the chair beside the table was thrown aheavylooking cape or cloak</s>
<s>I have only to get the form of election finished continuedGregory with animation then I snatch up this cloak and stickstuff these other things into my pocket step out of a door inthis cavern which opens on the river where there is a steamtugalready waiting for me and thenthenoh the wild joy of beingThursday</s> 
<s>And he clasped his hands</s>
<s>Syme who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languorgot to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation</s>
<s>Why is it he asked vaguely that I think you are quite a decentfellow</s> 
<s>Why do I positively like you Gregory</s> 
<s>He paused a momentand then added with a sort of fresh curiosity Is it because youare such an ass</s>
<s>There was a thoughtful silence again and then he cried out</s>
<s>Well damn it all</s> 
<s>this is the funniest situation I have ever beenin in my life and I am going to act accordingly</s> 
<s>Gregory I gaveyou a promise before I came into this place</s> 
<s>That promise I wouldkeep under redhot pincers</s> 
<s>Would you give me for my own safety alittle promise of the same kind</s> 
<s>A promise</s> 
<s>asked Gregory wondering</s>
<s>Yes said Syme very seriously a promise</s> 
<s>I swore before Godthat I would not tell your secret to the police</s> 
<s>Will you swear byHumanity or whatever beastly thing you believe in that you willnot tell my secret to the anarchists</s>
<s>Your secret</s> 
<s>asked the staring Gregory</s> 
<s>Have you got a secret</s>
<s>Yes said Syme I have a secret</s> 
<s>Then after a pause Will youswear</s>
<s>Gregory glared at him gravely for a few moments and then saidabruptly</s>
<s>You must have bewitched me but I feel a furious curiosity aboutyou</s> 
<s>Yes I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tellme</s> 
<s>But look sharp for they will be here in a couple of minutes</s>
<s>Syme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long white hands intohis long grey trousers pockets</s> 
<s>Almost as he did so there camefive knocks on the outer grating proclaiming the arrival of thefirst of the conspirators</s>
<s>Well said Syme slowly I dont know how to tell you the truthmore shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up asan aimless poet is not confined to you or your President</s> 
<s>We haveknown the dodge for some time at Scotland Yard</s>
<s>Gregory tried to spring up straight but he swayed thrice</s>
<s>What do you say</s> 
<s>he asked in an inhuman voice</s>
<s>Yes said Syme simply I am a police detective</s> 
<s>But I think Ihear your friends coming</s>
<s>From the doorway there came a murmur of Mr Joseph Chamberlain</s>
<s>It was repeated twice and thrice and then thirty times and thecrowd of Joseph Chamberlains (a solemn thought) could be heardtrampling down the corridor</s>
