[<s>The Man Who Was Thursday byy</s>G. K.<s> Chesterton 1908]]</s>
<s>To Edmund Clerihew Bentley

</s><s>A cloud was on the mind of men, and wailing went the weather,
Yea, a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boyss</s>together.
<s>Science announced nonentity and art admired decay;
The world was old and ended: but you and I were gay;
Round us in antic order their crippled vices came--
Lust that had lost its laughter, fear that had lost itss</s>shame.
<s>Like the white lock of Whistler, that lit our aimless gloom,
Men showed their own white feather as proudly as aa</s>plume.
<s>Life was a fly that faded, and death a drone that stung;
The world was very old indeed when you and I weree</s>young.
<s>They twisted even decent sin to shapes not to be named:
Men were ashamed of honour; but we were nott</s>ashamed.
<s>Weak if we were and foolish, not thus we failed, not thus;
When that black Baal blocked the heavens he had no hymns from us
Children we were--our forts of sand were even as weak as eve,
High as they went we piled them up to break thatt</s>bitter sea.
<s>Fools as we were in motley, all jangling and absurd,
When all church bells were silent our cap and beds weree</s>heard.<s>

</s><s>Not all unhelped we held the fort, our tiny flags unfurled;
Some giants laboured in that cloud to lift it from thee</s>world.
<s>I find again the book we found, I feel the hour that flings
Far out of fish-shaped Paumanok some cry of cleaner things;
And the Green Carnation withered, as in forest fires that pass,
Roared in the wind of all the world ten million leaves of grass;
Or sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sings in the rain--
Truth out of Tusitala spoke and pleasure out off</s>pain.
<s>Yea, cool and clear and sudden as a bird sings in the grey,
Dunedin to Samoa spoke, and darkness untoo</s>day.
<s>But we were young; we lived to see God breakk</s>their bitter charms.
<s>God and the good Republic come riding back in arms:
We have seen the City of Mansoul, even as it rocked, relieved--
Blessed are they who did not see, but being blind,,</s>believed.<s>

</s><s>This is a tale of those old fears, even of those emptied hells,
And none but you shall understand the true thing that it tells--
Of what colossal gods of shame could cow men and yet crash,
Of what huge devils hid the stars, yet fell at a pistoll</s>flash.
<s>The doubts that were so plain to chase, so dreadful to withstand--
Oh, who shall understand but you; yea, who shall understand?
The doubts that drove us through the night as we two talked amain,
And day had broken on the streets e'er it broke upon thee</s>brain.
<s>Between us, by the peace of God, such truth can now be told;
Yea, there is strength in striking root and good in growingg</s>old.
<s>We have found common things at last and marriage and a creed,
And I may safely write it now, and you may safelyy</s>read.<s>

</s><s>CHAPTER I

</s><s>THE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK

</s><s>THE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London, as
red and ragged as a cloud off</s>sunset.<s> It was built of a bright
brick throughout; its sky-line was fantastic, and even its ground
plan wass</s>wild.<s> It had been the outburst of a speculative builder,
faintly tinged with art, who called its architecture sometimes
Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne, apparently under the
impression that the two sovereigns weree</s>identical.<s> It was described
with some justice as an artistic colony, though it never in any
definable way produced anyy</s>art.<s> But although its pretensions to be
an intellectual centre were a little vague, its pretensions to be a
pleasant place were quitee</s>indisputable.<s> The stranger who looked for
the first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very
oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in too</s>them.<s> Nor when
he met the people was he disappointed in thiss</s>respect.<s> The place
was not only pleasant, but perfect, if once he could regard it not
as a deception but rather as aa</s>dream.<s> Even if the people were not
'artists,' the whole was neverthelesss</s>artistic.<s> That young man with
the long, auburn hair and the impudent face--that young man was not
really a poet; but surely he was aa</s>poem.<s> That old gentleman with
the wild, white beard and the wild, white hat--that venerable
humbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the cause
of philosophy inn</s>others.<s> That scientific gentleman with the bald,
egg-like head and the bare, bird-like neck had no real right to the
airs of science that hee</s>assumed.<s> He had not discovered anything new
in biology; but what biological creature could he have discovered
more singular than himself? Thus, and thus only, the whole place
had properly to be regarded; it had to be considered not so much
as a workshop for artists, but as a frail but finished work off</s>art.
<s>A man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had
stepped into a writtenn</s>comedy.<s>

</s><s>More especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about
nightfall, when the extravagant roofs were dark against the
afterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a
driftingg</s>cloud.<s> This again was more strongly true of the many
nights of local festivity, when the little gardens were often
illuminated, and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish
trees like some fierce and monstrouss</s>fruit.<s> And this was strongest
of all on one particular evening, still vaguely remembered in the
locality, of which the auburn-haired poet was thee</s>hero.<s> It was not
by any means the only evening of which he was thee</s>hero.<s> On many
nights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high,
didactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly too</s>women.<s> The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the
paradoxes of thee</s>place.<s> Most of the women were of the kind vaguely
called emancipated, and professed some protest against malee</s>supremacy.<s> Yet these new women would always pay to a man the
extravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him,
that of listening while he iss</s>talking.<s> Andd</s>Mr.<s> Lucian Gregory, the
red-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening
to, even if one only laughed at the end off</s>it.<s> He put the old cant
of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain
impudent freshness which gave at least a momentaryy</s>pleasure.<s> He was
helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance,
which he worked, as the phrase goes, for all it wass</s>worth.<s> His dark
red hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman's, and
curved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelitee</s>picture.
<s>From within this almost saintly oval, however, his face projected
suddenly broad and brutal, the chin carried forward with a look of
cockneyy</s>contempt.<s> This combination at once tickled and terrified
the nerves of a neuroticc</s>population.<s> He seemed like a walking
blasphemy, a blend of the angel and thee</s>ape.<s>

</s><s>This particular evening, if it is remembered for nothing else,
will be remembered in that place for its strangee</s>sunset.<s> It looked
like the end of thee</s>world.<s> All the heaven seemed covered with a
quite vivid and palpable plumage; you could only say that the sky
was full of feathers, and of feathers that almost brushed thee</s>face.<s> Across the great part of the dome they were grey, with the
strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale
green; but towards the west the whole grew past description,
transparent and passionate, and the last red-hot plumes of it
covered up the sun like something too good to bee</s>seen.<s> The whole
was so close about the earth, as to express nothing but a violentt</s>secrecy.<s> The very empyrean seemed to be aa</s>secret.<s> It expressed
that splendid smallness which is the soul of locall</s>patriotism.<s> The
very sky seemedd</s>small.<s>

</s><s>I say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening
if only by that oppressivee</s>sky.<s> There are others who may remember
it because it marked the first appearance in the place of the
second poet of Saffronn</s>Park.<s> For a long time the red-haired
revolutionary had reigned without a rival; it was upon the night
of the sunset that his solitude suddenlyy</s>ended.<s> The new poet, who
introduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very
mild-looking mortal, with a fair, pointed beard and faint, yelloww</s>hair.<s> But an impression grew that he was less meek than hee</s>looked.
<s>He signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet,
Gregory, upon the whole nature off</s>poetry.<s> He said that he (Syme)
was poet of law, a poet of order; nay, he said he was a poet off</s>respectability.<s> So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he
had that moment fallen out of that impossiblee</s>sky.<s>

</s><s>In fact,,</s>Mr.<s> Lucian Gregory, the anarchic poet, connected the twoo</s>events.<s>

</s><s>'It may well be,' he said, in his sudden lyrical manner, 'it may
well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is
brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectablee</s>poet.
<s>You say you are a poet of law; I say you are a contradiction inn</s>terms.<s> I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the
night you appeared in thiss</s>garden.<s>'

</s><s>The man with the meek blue eyes and the pale, pointed beard endured
these thunders with a certain submissivee</s>solemnity.<s> The third party
of the group, Gregory's sister Rosamond, who had her brother's
braids of red hair, but a kindlier face underneath them, laughed
with such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave
commonly to the familyy</s>oracle.<s>

</s><s>Gregory resumed in high oratorical goodd</s>humour.<s>

</s><s>'An artist is identical with an anarchist,' hee</s>cried.<s> 'You might
transpose the wordss</s>anywhere.<s> An anarchist is ann</s>artist.<s> The man
who throws a bomb is an artist, because he prefers a great moment
too</s>everything.<s> He sees how much more valuable is one burst of
blazing light, one peal of perfect thunder, than the mere common
bodies of a few shapelesss</s>policemen.<s> An artist disregards all
governments, abolishes alll</s>conventions.<s> The poet delights inn</s>disorder only.<s> If it were not so, the most poetical thing in the
world would be the Undergroundd</s>Railway.<s>'

</s><s>'So it is,' saidd</s>Mr. Syme.<s>

</s><s>'Nonsense!' said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone else
attemptedd</s>paradox.<s> 'Why do all the clerks and navvies in the
railway trains look so sad and tired, so very sad and tired? I will
telll</s>you.<s> It is because they know that the train is goingg</s>right.<s> It
is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket
for that place they willl</s>reach.<s> It is because after they have
passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be
Victoria, and nothing butt</s>Victoria.<s> Oh, their wild rapture! oh,
their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden, if the next
station were unaccountably Baker Street!'

</s><s>'It is you who are unpoetical,' replied the poett</s>Syme.<s> 'If what you
say of clerks is true, they can only be as prosaic ass</s>your poetry.
<s>The rare, strange thing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious
thing is to misss</s>it.<s> We feel it is epical when man with one wild
arrow strikes a distantt</s>bird.<s> Is it not also epical when man with
one wild engine strikes a distant station? Chaos is dull; because
in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street or too</s>Bagdad.<s> But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that
he does say Victoria, and lo! it iss</s>Victoria.<s> No, take your books
of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears off</s>pride.<s> Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give
me Bradshaw, who commemorates hiss</s>victories.<s> Give me Bradshaw, I
say!'

</s><s>'Must you go?' inquired Gregoryy</s>sarcastically.<s>

</s><s>'I tell you,' went on Syme with passion, 'that every time a train
comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers, and
that man has won a battle againstt</s>chaos.<s> You say contemptuously
that when one has left Sloane Square one must come too</s>Victoria.<s> I
say that one might do a thousand things instead, and that whenever
I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadthh</s>escape.<s> And
when I hear the guard shout out the word 'Victoria,' it is not an
unmeaningg</s>word.<s> It is to me the cry of a herald announcingg</s>conquest.<s> It is to me indeed 'Victoria'; it is the victory off</s>Adam.<s>'

</s><s>Gregory wagged his heavy, red head with a slow and sadd</s>smile.<s>

</s><s>'And even then,' he said, 'we poets always ask the question, 'And
what is Victoria now that you have got there ?' You think Victoria
is like the Neww</s>Jerusalem.<s> We know that the New Jerusalem will only
be likee</s>Victoria.<s> Yes, the poet will be discontented even in the
streets off</s>heaven.<s> The poet is always inn</s>revolt.<s>'

</s><s>'There again,' said Syme irritably, 'what is there poetical about
being in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to bee</s>sea-sick.<s> Being sick is aa</s>revolt.<s> Both being sick and being
rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate
occasions; but I'm hanged if I can see why they aree</s>poetical.
<s>Revolt in the abstractt</s>is--revolting.<s> It's meree</s>vomiting.<s>'

</s><s>The girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word, but Syme was
too hot to heedd</s>her.<s>

</s><s>'It is things going right,' he cried, 'that is poetical I Our
digestions, for instance, going sacredly and silently right, that
is the foundation of alll</s>poetry.<s> Yes, the most poetical thing, more
poetical than the flowers, more poetical than the stars--the most
poetical thing in the world is not beingg</s>sick.<s>'

</s><s>'Really,' said Gregory superciliously, 'the examples you choose--'

</s><s>'I beg your pardon,' said Syme grimly, 'I forgot we had abolished
alll</s>conventions.<s>'

</s><s>For the first time a red patch appeared on Gregory'ss</s>forehead.<s>

</s><s>'You don't expect me,' he said, 'to revolutionise society on this
lawn ?'

</s><s>Syme looked straight into his eyes and smiledd</s>sweetly.<s>

</s><s>'No, I don't,' he said; 'but I suppose that if you were serious
about your anarchism, that is exactly what you wouldd</s>do.<s>'

</s><s>Gregory's big bull's eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry
lion, and one could almost fancy that his red manee</s>rose.<s>

</s><s>'Don't you think, then,' he said in a dangerous voice, 'that I am
serious about my anarchism?'

</s><s>'I beg your pardon ?' saidd</s>Syme.<s>

</s><s>'Am I not serious about my anarchism ?' cried Gregory, with knottedd</s>fists.<s>

</s><s>'My dear fellow!' said Syme, and strolledd</s>away.<s>

</s><s>With surprise, but with a curious pleasure, he found Rosamond
Gregory still in hiss</s>company.<s>

</s>'Mr.<s> Syme,' she said, 'do the people who talk like you and my
brother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ?'

</s><s>Symee</s>smiled.<s>

</s><s>'Do you ?' hee</s>asked.<s>

</s><s>'What do you mean ?' asked the girl, with gravee</s>eyes.<s>

</s><s>'My dear Miss Gregory,' said Syme gently, 'there are many kinds of
sincerity andd</s>insincerity.<s> When you say 'thank you' for the salt,
do you mean what you say ??</s>No.<s> When you say 'the world is round,'
do you mean what you say ??</s>No.<s> It is true, but you don't meann</s>it.
<s>Now, sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he doess</s>mean.<s> It may be only a half-truth, quarter-truth, tenth-truth; but
then he says more than he means--from sheer force of meaningg</s>it.<s>'

</s><s>She was looking at him from under level brows; her face was grave
and open, and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that
unreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the most
frivolous woman, the maternal watch which is as old as thee</s>world.<s>

</s><s>'Is he really an anarchist, then?' shee</s>asked.<s>

</s><s>'Only in that sense I speak of,' replied Syme; 'or if you prefer
it, in thatt</s>nonsense.<s>'

</s><s>She drew her broad brows together and said abruptly--

</s><s>'He wouldn't really use--bombs or that sort of thing?'

</s><s>Syme broke into a great laugh, that seemed too large for his slight
and somewhat dandifiedd</s>figure.<s>

</s><s>'Good Lord, no!' he said, 'that has to be donee</s>anonymously.<s>'

</s><s>And at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile, and
she thought with a simultaneous pleasure of Gregory's absurdity
and of hiss</s>safety.<s>

</s><s>Syme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden, and
continued to pour out hiss</s>opinions.<s> For he was a sincere man, and
in spite of his superficial airs and graces, at root a humblee</s>one.
<s>And it is always the humble man who talks too much; the proud man
watches himself tooo</s>closely.<s> He defended respectability with
violence andd</s>exaggeration.<s> He grew passionate in his praise of
tidiness andd</s>propriety.<s> All the time there was a smell of lilac
all roundd</s>him.<s> Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a
barrel-organ begin to play, and it seemed to him that his heroic
words were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond thee</s>world.<s>

</s><s>He stared and talked at the girl's red hair and amused face for
what seemed to be a few minutes; and then, feeling that the groups
in such a place should mix, rose to hiss</s>feet.<s> To his astonishment,
he discovered the whole gardenn</s>empty.<s> Everyone had gone long ago,
and he went himself with a rather hurriedd</s>apology.<s> He left with a
sense of champagne in his head, which he could not afterwardss</s>explain.<s> In the wild events which were to follow this girl had no
part at all; he never saw her again until all his tale wass</s>over.
<s>And yet, in some indescribable way, she kept recurring like a
motive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards, and the
glory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those dark
and ill-drawn tapestries of thee</s>night.<s> For what followed was so
improbable, that it might well have been aa</s>dream.<s>

</s><s>When Syme went out into the starlit street, he found it for the
momentt</s>empty.<s> Then he realised (in some odd way) that the silence
was rather a living silence than a deadd</s>one.<s> Directly outside the
door stood a street lamp, whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree
that bent out over the fence behindd</s>him.<s> About a foot from the
lamp-post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the
lamp-postt</s>itself.<s> The tall hat and long frock coat were black; the
face, in an abrupt shadow, was almost ass</s>dark.<s> Only a fringe of
fiery hair against the light, and also something aggressive in the
attitude, proclaimed that it was the poett</s>Gregory.<s> He had something
of the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for hiss</s>foe.<s>

</s><s>He made a sort of doubtful salute, which Syme somewhat more
formallyy</s>returned.<s>

</s><s>'I was waiting for you,' saidd</s>Gregory.<s> 'Might I have a moment's
conversation?'

</s>'Certainly.<s> About what?' asked Syme in a sort of weakk</s>wonder.<s>

</s><s>Gregory struck out with his stick at the lamp-post, and then at thee</s>tree.<s> 'About this and this,' he cried; 'about order andd</s>anarchy.
<s>There is your precious order, that lean, iron lamp, ugly and
barren; and there is anarchy, rich, living, reproducing
itself--there is anarchy, splendid in green andd</s>gold.<s>'

</s><s>'All the same,' replied Syme patiently, 'just at present you only
see the tree by the light of thee</s>lamp.<s> I wonder when you would ever
see the lamp by the light of thee</s>tree.<s>' Then after a pause he said,
'But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only
to resume our little argument?'

</s><s>'No,' cried out Gregory, in a voice that rang down the street, 'I
did not stand here to resume our argument, but to end itt</s>for ever.<s>'

</s><s>The silence fell again, and Syme, though he understood nothing,
listened instinctively for somethingg</s>serious.<s> Gregory began in a
smooth voice and with a rather bewilderingg</s>smile.<s>

</s>'Mr.<s> Syme,' he said, 'this evening you succeeded in doing somethingg</s>rather remarkable.<s> You did something to me that no man born of
woman has ever succeeded in doingg</s>before.<s>'

</s><s>'Indeed!'

</s><s>'Now I remember,' resumed Gregory reflectively, 'one other person
succeeded in doingg</s>it.<s> The captain of a penny steamer (if I
remember correctly) att</s>Southend.<s> You have irritatedd</s>me.<s>'

</s><s>'I am very sorry,' replied Syme withh</s>gravity.<s>

</s><s>'I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped
out even with an apology,' said Gregory veryy</s>calmly.<s> 'No duel
could wipe itt</s>out.<s> If I struck you dead I could not wipe itt</s>out.
<s>There is only one way by which that insult can be erased, and that
way II</s>choose.<s> I am going, at the possible sacrifice of my life and
honour, to prove to you that you were wrong in what youu</s>said.<s>'

</s><s>'In what I said?'

</s><s>'You said I was not serious about being ann</s>anarchist.<s>'

</s><s>'There are degrees of seriousness,' repliedd</s>Syme.<s> 'I have never
doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense, that you
thought what you said well worth saying, that you thought a
paradox might wake men up to a neglectedd</s>truth.<s>'

</s><s>Gregory stared at him steadily andd</s>painfully.<s>

</s><s>'And in no other sense,' he asked, 'you think me serious? You think
me a flaneur who lets fall occasionall</s>truths.<s> You do not think that
in a deeper, a more deadly sense, I amm</s>serious.<s>'

</s><s>Syme struck his stick violently on the stones of thee</s>road.<s>

</s><s>'Serious!' hee</s>cried.<s> 'Good Lord! is this street serious? Are these
damned Chinese lanterns serious? Is the whole caboodle serious?
One comes here and talks a pack of bosh, and perhaps some sense as
well, but I should think very little of a man who didn't keep
something in the background of his life that was more serious than
all this talking--something more serious, whether it was religion
or onlyy</s>drink.<s>'

</s><s>'Very well,' said Gregory, his face darkening, 'you shall see
something more serious than either drinkk</s>or religion.<s>'

</s><s>Syme stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until Gregory
again opened hiss</s>lips.<s>

</s><s>'You spoke just now of having aa</s>religion.<s> Is it really true that
you have one?'

</s><s>'Oh,' said Syme with a beaming smile, 'we are all Catholicss</s>now.<s>'

</s><s>'Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your
religion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to
tell you to any son of Adam, and especially not to the police?
Will you swear that! If you will take upon yourself this awful
abnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow
that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream
about, I will promise you in return--'

</s><s>'You will promise me in return?' inquired Syme, as thee</s>other
paused.<s>

</s><s>'I will promise you a very entertainingg</s>evening.<s>' Syme suddenly
took off hiss</s>hat.<s>

</s><s>'Your offer,' he said, 'is far too idiotic to bee</s>declined.<s> You say
that a poet is always ann</s>anarchist.<s> I disagree; but I hope at least
that he is always aa</s>sportsman.<s> Permit me, here and now, to swear as
a Christian, and promise as a good comrade and a fellow-artist,
that I will not report anything of this, whatever it is, to thee</s>police.<s> And now, in the name of Colney Hatch, what is it?'

</s><s>'I think,' said Gregory, with placid irrelevancy, 'that we will
call aa</s>cab.<s>'

</s><s>He gave two long whistles, and a hansom came rattling down thee</s>road.<s> The two got into it inn</s>silence.<s> Gregory gave through the
trap the address of an obscure public-house on the Chiswick bank
of thee</s>river.<s> The cab whisked itself away again, and in it these
two fantastics quitted their fantasticc</s>town.<s>

</s><s>

</s><s>CHAPTER II

</s><s>THE SECRET OF GABRIEL SYME

</s><s>THE cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop,
into which Gregory rapidly conducted hiss</s>companion.<s> They seated
themselves in a close and dim sort of bar-parlour, at a stained
wooden table with one woodenn</s>leg.<s> The room was so small and dark,
that very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned,
beyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky andd</s>bearded.<s>

</s><s>'Will you take a little supper?' asked Gregoryy</s>politely.<s> 'The pate
de foie gras is not good here, but I can recommend thee</s>game.<s>'

</s><s>Syme received the remark with stolidity, imagining it to be aa</s>joke.
<s>Accepting the vein of humour, he said, with a well-bred
indifference--

</s><s>'Oh, bring me somee</s>lobster mayonnaise.<s>'

</s><s>To his indescribable astonishment, the man only said 'Certainly,
sir!' and went away apparently to gett</s>it.<s>

</s><s>'What will you drink?' resumed Gregory, with the same careless yet
apologeticc</s>air.<s> 'I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself; I havee</s>dined.<s> But the champagne can really bee</s>trusted.<s> Do let me start you
with a half-bottle of Pommery at least?'

</s><s>'Thank you!' said the motionlesss</s>Syme.<s> 'You are veryy</s>good.<s>'

</s><s>His further attempts at conversation, somewhat disorganised in
themselves, were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the
actual appearance of thee</s>lobster.<s> Syme tasted it, and found it
particularlyy</s>good.<s> Then he suddenly began to eat with great
rapidity andd</s>appetite.<s>

</s><s>'Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously!' he said to Gregory,,</s>smiling.<s> 'I don't often have the luck to have a dream likee</s>this.<s> It
is new to me for a nightmare to lead to aa</s>lobster.<s> It is commonly
thee</s>other way.<s>'

</s><s>'You are not asleep, I assure you,' saidd</s>Gregory.<s> 'You are, on the
contrary, close to the most actual and rousing moment off</s>your
existence.<s> Ah, here comes your champagne! I admit that there may be
a slight disproportion, let us say, between the inner arrangements
of this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentiouss</s>exterior.
<s>But that is alll</s>our modesty.<s> We are the most modest men that ever
lived onn</s>earth.<s>'

</s><s>'And who are we?' asked Syme, emptying his champagnee</s>glass.<s>

</s><s>'It is quite simple,' repliedd</s>Gregory.<s> 'We are the serious
anarchists, in whom you do nott</s>believe.<s>'

</s><s>'Oh!' said Symee</s>shortly.<s> 'You do yourselves well inn</s>drinks.<s>'

</s><s>'Yes, we are serious about everything,' answeredd</s>Gregory.<s>

</s><s>Then after a pause he added--

</s><s>'If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little,
don't put it down to your inroads into thee</s>champagne.<s> I don't wish
you to do yourself ann</s>injustice.<s>'

</s><s>'Well, if I am not drunk, I am mad,' replied Syme with perfect
calm; 'but I trust I can behave like a gentleman inn</s>either
condition.<s> May I smoke?'

</s><s>'Certainly!' said Gregory, producing aa</s>cigar-case.<s> 'Try one off</s>mine.<s>'

</s><s>Syme took the cigar, clipped the end off with a cigar-cutter out
of his waistcoat pocket, put it in his mouth, lit it slowly, and
let out a long cloud off</s>smoke.<s> It is not a little to his credit
that he performed these rites with so much composure, for almost
before he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to
revolve, first slowly, and then rapidly, as if at an insanee</s>seance.<s>

</s><s>'You must not mind it,' said Gregory; 'it's a kind off</s>screw.<s>'

</s><s>'Quite so,' said Syme placidly, 'a kind off</s>screw.<s> How simple that
is!'

</s><s>The next moment the smoke of his cigar, which had been wavering
across the room in snaky twists, went straight up as if from a
factory chimney, and the two, with their chairs and table, shot
down through the floor as if the earth had swallowedd</s>them.<s> They
went rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as rapidly as a lift
cut loose, and they came with an abrupt bump to thee</s>bottom.<s> But
when Gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a red
subterranean light, Syme was still smoking with one leg thrown
over the other, and had not turned a yelloww</s>hair.<s>

</s><s>Gregory led him down a low, vaulted passage, at the end of which
was the redd</s>light.<s> It was an enormous crimson lantern, nearly as
big as a fireplace, fixed over a small but heavy ironn</s>door.<s> In the
door there was a sort of hatchway or grating, and on this Gregory
struck fivee</s>times.<s> A heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him
who hee</s>was.<s> To this he gave the more or less unexpected reply,,</s>'Mr.<s> Josephh</s>Chamberlain.<s>' The heavy hinges began to move; it was
obviously some kind off</s>password.<s>

</s><s>Inside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a
network off</s>steel.<s> On a second glance, Syme saw that the glittering
pattern was really made up of ranks and ranks of rifles and
revolvers, closely packedd</s>or interlocked.<s>

</s><s>'I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities,' said Gregory;
'we have to be very strictt</s>here.<s>'

</s><s>'Oh, don't apologise,' saidd</s>Syme.<s> 'I know your passion for law and
order,' and he stepped into the passage lined with the steell</s>weapons.<s> With his long, fair hair and rather foppish frock-coat, he
looked a singularly frail and fanciful figure as he walked down
that shining avenue off</s>death.<s>

</s><s>They passed through several such passages, and came out at last
into a queer steel chamber with curved walls, almost spherical in
shape, but presenting, with its tiers of benches, something of the
appearance of a scientificc</s>lecture-theatre.<s> There were no rifles or
pistols in this apartment, but round the walls of it were hung more
dubious and dreadful shapes, things that looked like the bulbs of
iron plants, or the eggs of ironn</s>birds.<s> They were bombs, and the
very room itself seemed like the inside of aa</s>bomb.<s> Syme knocked his
cigar ash off against the wall, and wentt</s>in.<s>

</s><s>'And now, myy</s>dear Mr.<s> Syme,' said Gregory, throwing himself in an
expansive manner on the bench under the largest bomb, 'now we are
quite cosy, so let us talkk</s>properly.<s> Now no human words can give
you any notion of why I brought youu</s>here.<s> It was one of those quite
arbitrary emotions, like jumping off a cliff or falling inn</s>love.
<s>Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow,
and, to do you justice, you aree</s>still.<s> I would break twenty oaths
of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down aa</s>peg.<s> That way you
have of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal off</s>confession.<s> Well, you said that you were quite certain I was not a
seriouss</s>anarchist.<s> Does this place strike you as being serious?'

</s><s>'It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety,' assented
Syme; 'but may I ask you two questions? You need not fear to give
me information, because, as you remember, you very wisely extorted
from me a promise not to tell the police, a promise I shall
certainlyy</s>keep.<s> So it is in mere curiosity that I make myy</s>queries.
<s>First of all, what is it really all about? What is it you object
to? You want to abolish Government?'

</s><s>'To abolish God!' said Gregory, opening the eyes of aa</s>fanatic.<s> 'We
do not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations;
that sort of anarchism does exist, but it is a mere branch of thee</s>Nonconformists.<s> We dig deeper and we blow youu</s>higher.<s> We wish to
deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue, honour
and treachery, upon which mere rebels basee</s>themselves.<s> The silly
sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of
Man! We hate Rights as we hatee</s>Wrongs.<s> We have abolished Right andd</s>Wrong.<s>'

</s><s>'And Right and Left,' said Syme with a simple eagerness, 'I hope
you will abolish themm</s>too.<s> They are much more troublesome too</s>me.<s>'

</s><s>'You spoke of a second question,' snappedd</s>Gregory.<s>

</s><s>'With pleasure,' resumedd</s>Syme.<s> 'In all your present acts and
surroundings there is a scientific attempt att</s>secrecy.<s> I have an
aunt who lived over a shop, but this is the first time I have
found people living from preference under aa</s>public-house.<s> You have
a heavy ironn</s>door.<s> You cannot pass it without submitting to the
humiliation of calling yourselff</s>Mr. Chamberlain.<s> You surround
yourself with steel instruments which make the place, if I may say
so, more impressive thann</s>homelike.<s> May I ask why, after taking all
this trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth,
you then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to
every silly woman in Saffron Park?'

</s><s>Gregoryy</s>smiled.<s>

</s><s>'The answer is simple,' hee</s>said.<s> 'I told you I was a serious
anarchist, and you did not believee</s>me.<s> Nor do they believee</s>me.
<s>Unless I took them into this infernal room they would not believee</s>me.<s>'

</s><s>Syme smoked thoughtfully, and looked at him withh</s>interest.<s> Gregory
wentt</s>on.<s>

</s><s>'The history of the thing might amuse you,' hee</s>said.<s> 'When first I
became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectablee</s>disguises.<s> I dressed up as aa</s>bishop.<s> I read up all about bishops
in our anarchist pamphlets, in Superstition the Vampire and
Priests off</s>Prey.<s> I certainly understood from them that bishops are
strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret fromm</s>mankind.
<s>I wass</s>misinformed.<s> When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters
in a drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder, 'Down! down!
presumptuous human reason!' they found out in some way that I was
not a bishop att</s>all.<s> I was nabbed att</s>once.<s> Then I made up as a
millionaire; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that
a fool could see that I was quitee</s>poor.<s> Then I tried being aa</s>major.<s> Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope, enough
intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like
Nietzsche, admire violence--the proud, mad war of Nature and all
that, youu</s>know.<s> I threw myself into thee</s>major.<s> I drew my sword and
waved itt</s>constantly.<s> I called out 'Blood!' abstractedly, like a
man callingg</s>for wine.<s> I often said, 'Let the weak perish; it is
thee</s>Law.<s>' Well, well, it seems majors don't doo</s>this.<s> I was nabbedd</s>again.<s> At last I went in despair to the President of the Central
Anarchist Council, who is the greatest man inn</s>Europe.<s>'

</s><s>'What is his name?' askedd</s>Syme.<s>

</s><s>'You would not know it,' answeredd</s>Gregory.<s> 'That is hiss</s>greatness.
<s>Caesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of, and
they were heardd</s>of.<s> He puts all his genius into not being heard of,
and he is not heardd</s>of.<s> But you cannot be for five minutes in the
room with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would have
been children in hiss</s>hands.<s>'

</s><s>He was silent and even pale for a moment, and then resumed--

</s><s>'But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling
as an epigram, and yet as practical as the Bank off</s>England.<s> I said
to him, 'What disguise will hide me from the world? What can I find
more respectable than bishops and majors?' He looked at me with his
large but indecipherablee</s>face.<s> 'You want a safe disguise, do you?
You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless; a dress in
which no one would ever look for a bomb?' II</s>nodded.<s> He suddenly
lifted his lion'ss</s>voice.<s> 'Why, then, dress up as an anarchist, you
fool!' he roared so that the roomm</s>shook.<s> 'Nobody will ever expect
you to do anything dangerouss</s>then.<s>' And he turned his broad back
on me withoutt</s>another word.<s> I took his advice, and have never
regrettedd</s>it.<s> I preached blood and murder to those women day and
night, and--by God!--they would let me wheell</s>their perambulators.<s>'

</s><s>Syme sat watching him with some respect in his large, bluee</s>eyes.<s>

</s><s>'You took me in,' hee</s>said.<s> 'It is really a smartt</s>dodge.<s>'

</s><s>Then after a pause he added--

</s><s>'What do you call this tremendous President of yours?'

</s><s>'We generally call him Sunday,' replied Gregory withh</s>simplicity.
<s>'You see, there are seven members of the Central Anarchist
Council, and they are named after days of thee</s>week.<s> He is called
Sunday, by some of his admirers Bloodyy</s>Sunday.<s> It is curious you
should mention the matter, because the very night you have dropped
in (if I may so express it) is the night on which our London
branch, which assembles in this room, has to elect its own deputy
to fill a vacancy in thee</s>Council.<s> The gentleman who has for some
time past played, with propriety and general applause, the
difficult part of Thursday, has died quitee</s>suddenly.<s> Consequently,
we have called a meeting this very evening to elect aa</s>successor.<s>'

</s><s>He got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of
smilingg</s>embarrassment.<s>

</s><s>'I feel somehow as if you were my mother, Syme,' he continuedd</s>casually.<s> 'I feel that I can confide anything to you, as you have
promised to telll</s>nobody.<s> In fact, I will confide to you something
that I would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be
coming to the room in about tenn</s>minutes.<s> We shall, of course, go
through a form of election; but I don't mind telling you that it is
practically certain what the result willl</s>be.<s>' He looked down for a
momentt</s>modestly.<s> 'It is almost a settled thing that I am to bee</s>Thursday.<s>'

</s><s>'Myy</s>dear fellow.<s>' said Syme heartily, 'I congratulatee</s>you.<s> A great
career!'

</s><s>Gregory smiled in deprecation, and walked across the room, talkingg</s>rapidly.<s>

</s><s>'As a matter of fact, everything is ready for me on this table,' he
said, 'and the ceremony will probably be the shortestt</s>possible.<s>'

</s><s>Syme also strolled across to the table, and found lying across it a
walking-stick, which turned out on examination to be a sword-stick,
a large Colt's revolver, a sandwich case, and a formidable flask off</s>brandy.<s> Over the chair, beside the table, was thrown a
heavy-looking capee</s>or cloak.<s>

</s><s>'I have only to get the form of election finished,' continued
Gregory with animation, 'then I snatch up this cloak and stick,
stuff these other things into my pocket, step out of a door in
this cavern, which opens on the river, where there is a steam-tug
already waiting for me, and then--then--oh, the wild joy of being
Thursday!' And he clasped hiss</s>hands.<s>

</s><s>Syme, who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor,
got to his feet with an unusual air off</s>hesitation.<s>

</s><s>'Why is it,' he asked vaguely, 'that I think you are quite a decent
fellow? Why do I positively like you, Gregory?' He paused a moment,
and then added with a sort of fresh curiosity, 'Is it because you
are such an ass?'

</s><s>There was a thoughtful silence again, and then he cried out--

</s><s>'Well, damn it all! this is the funniest situation I have ever been
in in my life, and I am going to actt</s>accordingly.<s> Gregory, I gave
you a promise before I came into thiss</s>place.<s> That promise I would
keep under red-hott</s>pincers.<s> Would you give me, for my own safety, a
little promise of the same kind? '

</s><s>'A promise?' asked Gregory,,</s>wondering.<s>

</s><s>'Yes,' said Syme very seriously, 'aa</s>promise.<s> I swore before God
that I would not tell your secret to thee</s>police.<s> Will you swear by
Humanity, or whatever beastly thing you believe in, that you will
not tell my secret to the anarchists?'

</s><s>'Your secret?' asked the staringg</s>Gregory.<s> 'Have you got a secret?'

</s><s>'Yes,' said Syme, 'I have aa</s>secret.<s>' Then after a pause, 'Will you
swear?'

</s><s>Gregory glared at him gravely for a few moments, and then said
abruptly--

</s><s>'You must have bewitched me, but I feel a furious curiosity aboutt</s>you.<s> Yes, I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you telll</s>me.<s> But look sharp, for they will be here in a couple off</s>minutes.<s>'

</s><s>Syme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long, white hands into
his long, grey trousers''</s>pockets.<s> Almost as he did so there came
five knocks on the outer grating, proclaiming the arrival of the
first of thee</s>conspirators.<s>

</s><s>'Well,' said Syme slowly, 'I don't know how to tell you the truth
more shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as
an aimless poet is not confined to youu</s>or your President.<s> We have
known the dodge for some time at Scotlandd</s>Yard.<s>'

</s><s>Gregory tried to spring up straight, but he swayedd</s>thrice.<s>

</s><s>'What do you say?' he asked in an inhumann</s>voice.<s>

</s><s>'Yes,' said Syme simply, 'I am a policee</s>detective.<s> But I think I
hear your friendss</s>coming.<s>'

</s><s>From the doorway there came a murmur off</s>'Mr.<s> Josephh</s>Chamberlain.<s>'
It was repeated twice and thrice, and then thirty times, and the
crowd of Joseph Chamberlains (a solemn thought) could be heard
trampling down thee</s>corridor.<s>
